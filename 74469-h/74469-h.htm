<p class="ph2">THE PRODIGAL AND THE WAGER.</p>


<p>"Wasson, what is a <i>tramp</i>?"</p>

<p>"Dunno."</p>

<p>"Cleveland, what is a <i>tramp</i>?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Wasson, accommodate me, if you please, by introducing the extremity of
your boot to Mr. Cleveland."</p>

<p>"Ouch! What in thunder are you kicking me for, Wasson?"</p>

<p>"I'm not kicking you; extremes meet, my boy, and there was a natural
repulsion. Hough wants to know what a tramp is!"</p>

<p>"How do I know! Ah! here comes Smythe; he will tell you."</p>

<p>"Ah, Smythe, my boy, just in time! Wasson don't know any thing,
and Cleveland won't tell what he does know; what's a tramp? There
now—that's a good fellow—don't open your mouth so; you'll injure your
neck,—just tell me all you know about them."</p>

<p>"What's a which? Tramp!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a poll parrot, Smythe. Tell me what they are. You've been
to college and learned to row, and box, and play base ball, and ought
to know nearly every thing. Here I am continually reading about them.
Every paper you pick up is full of them. Tramp, <i>tramp</i>, TRAMP, from
one end of the paper to the other. There is not a chicken purloined
off a roost; a man killed; a house fired; a train ditched; virtue
outraged, vice embellished, or deviltry of any kind perpetrated, but
this omnipresent scape-goat of the nineteenth century appears to be at
the bottom of it all. Now I want to know what a tramp is."</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I cannot enlighten you, Hough, but—"</p>

<p>"But," exclaimed Wasson, interrupting Smythe, "if I am not very much
mistaken, here comes a gentleman who can!" And as the lawn gate swung
to its place, with a clang of the latch, there appeared walking up the
gravelled walk, a being, whose every square inch of superficial surface
indicated a <i>bona fide</i>, unadulterated specimen of the genus vagabond.</p>

<p>A frock coat,—guiltless of buttons, (save the two in the rear, where
they were of no earthly use)—with half a frock gone, and the remainder
of the garment mottled like unto the celebrated garment that got Joseph
in a hole, was fastened at the neck with a glittering horse-shoe nail.
A pair of pants, fantastically fringed with ragged ends about their
extremities, higher up bore the brands of many a camp-fire. Their
original color had long since struck to the over-powering allied forces
of wind and weather, mud and grease. In a landscape they might have
looked a subdued maroon, etched with lampblack. Below the fantastic
fringe work appeared a pair of feet encased in a boot and a shoe.
The shoe had evidently seen better days, and seemed to shrink with
humiliated pride from the forced companionship of the boot, which
was a plebeian of the Stogie family. The shoe was long, narrow and
pointed. The boot was coarse, thick and stubby. The toe of the boot
had an air-hole in it, extending clean across the upper. The shoe was
intact, and had a brass buckle the size of a door plate, which give
it an air of fallen greatness. But the boot was in proud possession
of a heel, while the shoe had none, equalizing matters. In glaring
contrast to this tatterdemalion attire, the hat, that completed the
picture, was a new straw affair, and looked like a bright, fresh,
shingle roof, clapped on a very dilapidated, old building. The face
beneath the hat was round and plump, very dirty, quite keen, frescoed
with tobacco-juice and embossed with a short, stumpy beard. As the
figure drew nigh the group on the lawn, boot, shoe, pants, coat and
face seemed to blend into an animated object, while the bran new hat
kept calling out, like a side-show man on a fair ground, "Here we
are! Now you have us! An epitome of Hard Times! A parody on financial
acumen! A caricature on the fat of the land! What aint rags is dirt,
and what aint dirt is bugs! We're the remnant of other days! We're the
breaking-up-of-a-hard-winter! We're a pariah, a scavenger, an outcast!
That's what we are, and we want you to know it. Here's your prodigal
for you! Kill your fatted calf of kitchen fag-ends and serve up the
banquet on the back door step. Bring out the purple and fine linen of
your ragbags. Here's your prodigal, and he's come back hungry!"</p>

<p>But though the hat said this, as plain as a hat could, the figure
beneath the hat spoke quite differently. Having, with a faltering step
and a pronounced limp in the shoe foot, approached the four gentlemen
who were enjoying their after dinner cigars on the lawn, the figure
with a keen, swift glance took an inventory of each person before him,
and then pulling off the new hat—to the great joy of a lot of hair
that appeared relieved from the constraints of good society—it said,
in a mumbling voice:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, this is the saddest moment of my life. I am no professional
beggar, but the victim of misfortunes, and reduced from comfort to my
present state of want by calamities over which I had no control. If you
could give me some assistance it would be a great blessing to me, and
a noble act for you; for I have not had a bite to eat for <i>four days</i>,
and my clothes would drop off of me with starvation if they were not
falling off from raggedness."</p>

<p>"Four days!" exclaimed all.</p>

<p>"Four days," solemnly reasserted the figure.</p>

<p>"And you still live!" said Hough.</p>

<p>"I still live," returned the figure, as solemnly as before, but with a
shrewd, covert little glance at Hough accompanying the answer.</p>

<p>Wasson noticed the glance, and laughed. Cleveland looked up and the
prodigal greeted him with a benignant smile. Smythe withdrew his hands
from their repose in his pockets, and, with open mouth, gazed first
at the patrician shoe, then at the plebeian boot, then at the subdued,
maroon colored, landscape pants, then at the skirtless coat, and at
last fastened his attention on the fascination of the brilliant,
galvanized-iron, horse-shoe nail.</p>

<p>"Are—are you a—<span class="smcap">Tramp</span>?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir!" emphatically and indignantly replied the prodigal.</p>

<p>"Then we're lost!" exclaimed all four, and Hough continued, "Had you
been a tramp I'd have given you a dollar."</p>

<p>The prodigal looked surprised—a trifle suspicious. For the first time
in his life he found his vagabondage quoted at a premium.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "pardon me if my native modesty prompted me
to deny the truth. I will confess that, having spent my substance
in assisting the miseries of others, I am, through the fault of my
own generosity and moral rectitude, at last brought to that sad
phase of mortal existence comprehended by the name "tramp." I <i>am</i> a
tramp—and I do not say it boastingly—; Heaven forbid!" And with a
smile of ineffable sweetness, in which dirt and "native modesty" were
harmoniously blended, the prodigal meekly folded his hands and rolled
his eyes skywards.</p>

<p>"Found, at last!" exclaimed all.</p>

<p>The incidents of this chapter occurred one sunny August afternoon, on
the lawn in front of Smythe's summer cottage on Long Island Sound, not
far from the lovely little village of Greenwich.</p>

<p>Smythe's cottage was a pretty little piece of carpenter work in the
Swiss chatelet style—so delightfully expensive and romantic.</p>

<p>Algernon Smythe was the son of his father. A clear understanding of
this matter is necessary inasmuch as the ancestral Smythes bore the
name of <i>Smith</i>, and the one immediately preceding Algernon had <i>his</i>
"Smith" decorated with the prefix Josiah. Josiah Smith drifted away
from the cobble stones of Connecticut—where the <i>Smith</i> family had
long been at warfare with the rocks about the possession of a few acres
of sterile, sorrel-trodden, ground,—at an early age, and found his
way to New York City. With him came the customary solitary shilling.
But this <i>Smith</i> shilling was an inflationist. It swelled itself into
houses and lots, and stocks and bonds, and shaved notes and fore-closed
mortgages, and fifty per cent. premiums on seven per cent. loans, and
kept itself so busily employed that when Josiah Smith retired from
active life and took up a permanent residence in Greenwood, his only
son and heir found himself sole master of a million of money. This
was too much wealth to be comfortably worn by the name of Smith. Why,
Algernon could remember when he was a little fellow, sanding sugar and
dusting spices in his father's store, familiar little boys,—who were
manœuvering for raisins,—used to affectionately call him "Smiffy!"</p>

<p>As a consequence when Algernon returned from Paris (<i>Pahree</i> he called
it) he no longer intruded the private "i" into the public eye, but
put a "y" in place of it. Then, that his name might be parted in the
middle,—to match his hair,—he tapered off the "i"-less creation with
an "e"; adopted a coat of arms; selected a motto; wanted to know if
Connecticut was not somewhere in Massachusetts "you know"; always said
<i>brava!</i> at the opera; and bought him a yacht!</p>

<p>Of the other guests at the cottage; Mr. Hough was the relative
appendage of a City Savings Bank. He drew $3,500 per annum from the
bank and several thousand from other sources. Mr. Wasson was generally
supposed to be an artist. He was always going to have a picture
finished for the next exhibition. "A thing that Church or Bierstadt
might be proud of." Meanwhile a doting father, who, in a distant
Massachusetts town, had first made shoes on his own knees, but now
made them on the knees of some five hundred of his fellow men, kindly
furnished him with a liberal means of subsistence until his profession
was established on a paying basis.</p>

<p>Benjamin Cleveland was a young fellow, but little more than
twenty-three. His mother had belonged to an old Boston family.</p>

<p>When Ben was ten years old his widowed mother died leaving him to the
tender care of his uncle, with a legacy of twenty thousand dollars.
By means of this inheritance he had obtained liberal educational
advantages,—attaining his majority shortly after graduating (without
any honors) at Yale. (Bostonians take honors at Harvard.) After
leaving college he diligently applied himself to the problem of life.
He had determined upon making his mark in the world. Nearly all young
men do so determine. The "mark" up to the opening of this narrative
was neither a very prominent or promising one. On his twenty-first
birth-day his uncle, who neither understood or sympathized with
him,—in fact rather disliked him,—paid into Ben's hands $15,450,
the remainder of the legacy left by his mother, and bade him "God
speed";—a fashion some people have of shifting on to God's shoulders
responsibilities that belong on their own. For a couple of years Ben
enjoyed himself looking around among his fellow men, and at the age of
twenty-three had $10,400 left to his bank account. He was fond of good
living, fond of adventure, fond of sport, fond of being his own master,
fond of a congenial laziness, and fond of every thing pertaining to
good health save hum-drum work, and money-making by the "plod" process.
He could lie on his back and build castles in the air all day long. But
it is doubtful if he would have undertaken the exertion of going twenty
rods to get one of the foundation stones to commence one of his castles
with. He was something of a <i>dreamer</i>. Not much of a <i>doer</i>. He ignored
the past; enjoyed the present; neglected the future.</p>

<p>Several moments elapsed in silence, while the lawn party surveyed the
<i>rara-avis</i> before them. The prodigal was the first to speak. Extending
his hand toward Hough, he suggestively remarked, "Where are you, boss?"</p>

<p>"Here is your dollar," replied Hough, presenting him one; "you have
earned it, my friend, by your truthfulness. Now, my friend, tell me
what a tramp is?"</p>

<p>"Why, a tramp's a tramp," replied the prodigal.</p>

<p>"Concise, if not lucid," remarked Wasson.</p>

<p>"Yes, but <i>what</i> are they, who are they, where are they, what do they
do and where do they go?" persisted Hough.</p>

<p>The prodigal quietly picked a gravel stone out of the gaping toe of
the boot, and answered, "They're <i>tramps</i>; that's what they are.
Dead-brokes; bums; beats; codjers; hand-out solicitors; cross-tie
sailors; free-lunch fiends; centennial rangers; square-meal crusaders!
They're everywhere, they do every thing, and go all over. They're
the great American travellers of the nineteenth century. Explorers.
Progressionists. Agrarians. I'm one of 'em myself, I am! I'm just from
New Orleans, and going to Boston," and the prodigal stopped to request
a donation of tobacco.</p>

<p>"But where do they live?" asked Wasson.</p>

<p>"Great Blazes! They live where they eat! What a question!" And the
prodigal completely annihilated poor Wasson by rolling his eyes upon
him in supreme astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what do they eat? You know they must eat, or they would not
live;" and Smythe felt that he had cornered him.</p>

<p>"True for you sir. Well they eat mostly at different places. When
in New York some of them like to stop at the Astor, and others
again prefer rooming in the lumber piles and taking their meals at
Delmonico's. The Fifth Avenue is good enough for me though;" and he
smiled upon Smythe, and Algernon opened his eyes and mouth to their
fullest extent.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever work? Do you never care to earn money at labor?" asked
Wasson.</p>

<p>"Work! Labor! Me! I'm not used to it, but I don't stand back from it
on that account. No sir. I love to work. Do you know of any body that
wants a hand to help cut ice, or can strawberries, or take astronomical
observations? If you do, tell me, for I'm their man. Work! I <i>adore</i>
it!" and his face expressed his adoration.</p>

<p>"How long did it take you to come from New Orleans?" asked Hough.</p>

<p>The prodigal studied a moment, and then replied, "I left New Orleans on
the 20th of last month. I made St. Louis in eight days and it's taken
me two weeks and a trifle more to come from St. Louis here."</p>

<p>"Why, that is over one hundred miles a day! You're a fast walker," said
Hough.</p>

<p>"Walk! Who said anything about walking? Not much. I walked when I felt
like it, and I rode when I felt like it."</p>

<p>"You had money, then?" asked Wasson.</p>

<p>"Money!" exclaimed he of the maroon pants, disdainfully. "Money! Nary
red. What did I want of money. Any fool can travel with money. I beat
my way!" and a look of conscious pride illumined his face.</p>

<p>"Came from New Orleans here in three weeks, without any money!" And the
magnitude of the undertaking so overwhelmed Mr. Smythe that he viewed
the tramp as a second Humboldt.</p>

<p>"Step around to the kitchen and tell them to give you something to
eat."</p>

<p>"No, I'm obliged to you, stranger. I just had two squares and three
hand-outs, and I couldn't eat another morsel. I'm sorry, but such is
the fact," replied the prodigal to the utter neglect of his assertion
that for four days he had not tasted food.</p>

<p>When Wasson reminded him of it, he coolly remarked that it was true
enough, and arose from his having a terrible toothache that prevented
his tasting any thing.</p>

<p>"I must tear myself from you, gentlemen," he continued. "Time is
precious, and although I enjoy your society, I must not neglect
business. I'm much obliged for the dollar, mister. I'll spend it
usefully and judiciously. Ta, ta!" and with a free and easy wave of
his hand, the tramp turned and walked jauntily down the gravelled walk
without the slightest sign of the limp he entered with.</p>

<p>After his departure Hough broke out in a boisterous fit of hilarity.</p>

<p>"That's a <i>tramp</i>!" he exclaimed. "We have seen the elephant, now,
gentlemen, what do <i>you</i> think of him?"</p>

<p>"What a supreme amount of <i>chic</i>!" said Smythe, whom, it will be
remembered, had been to Paris.</p>

<p>"Grand! Glorious! It's a fortune to him!" replied Hough, feigning to be
lost in admiration. And Cleveland said, meditatively,</p>

<p>"Three thousand miles in three weeks without a cent! By Jove!"</p>

<p>But Wasson rejoined that he did not believe a word of it.</p>

<p>"It can't be done," said Smythe, positively. "No man could do it. <i>I</i>
couldn't do it myself!"</p>

<p>"Yes it <i>can</i> be done," cried Cleveland, "whether <i>you</i> could do it or
not. <i>I</i> could do it."</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"I'd be willing to give you three months, and wager that then you could
not. You'd starve to death in three days, and commence telegraphing us
to come and bring you home before you crossed New Jersey," said Smythe,
contemptuously deriding the idea of Cleveland's undertaking the feat.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure about that, Smythe," retorted Cleveland, warming up.
"What man has done, man can do. If that fellow came from New Orleans
here in a little over three weeks without a cent, I can go from here to
New Orleans in the same time on a like amount of money. I'll wager ten
thousand dollars I can do it!" And Mr. Benjamin Cleveland arose to his
feet and nodded his head in an aggressive manner, though he had not the
remotest idea his challenge would be accepted, and only made the boast
to support his assertion. Great then was his surprise—and a surprise
not untinctured with consternation, when Smythe quickly replied, "I
take the bet. Hough, Wasson, you heard Ben. It's a bargain. When will
you start, Cleveland?"</p>

<p>But Ben courageously backed his assertion by quickly replying,</p>

<p>"To-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Cleveland, don't make a fool of yourself," spoke up Wasson.
"Even if that fellow did really do as he says he did, remember, he is a
<i>professional tramp</i>, and you would be but a novice, at best. You will
lose your money, sure."</p>

<p>"I'm not urgent about the matter, only I do not like a man to be so
positive about a thing he knows nothing of. You can draw the wager if
you wish, Ben," said Smythe.</p>

<p>The manner in which he said it, however, nettled Ben, and though he
had made his wager thoughtlessly, and without a consideration of the
humiliations, privations, and hardships embraced in the proposed feat,
he refused to retract.</p>

<p>"No, Smythe ... I don't take water. The bet is made. Let it stand."</p>

<p>There was a peculiar stubbornness in Ben's nature that compelled him
after having made a boast to carry it out. Besides, the proposition was
attractive from its startling novelty. It was an excitement his nature
craved. In the quick communion of his mind the following thoughts
resolved themselves into argumentative forces. "I'm a worthless,
shiftless, good-for-nothing fellow anyway. I'm not rich enough to
support the life I would like to lead, and I know nothing about
'money-making.' I need a good, practical knowledge of the world more
than any thing else in it. A good shaking up. How to obtain it I don't
know. There are undoubtedly thousands of channels open, but they are
hidden from me. I have $10,400. If I lose my wager, I am young and the
world is before me. If I <i>win</i>, I'll have enough to take me to Europe
and see the sights for a couple of years. At all events, there are none
interested save myself. I am alone in the world; none dependent on me,
I'm dependent on none. Responsible to no one for my acts,—none to
console a misfortune—nor to share a triumph. I'll go!"</p>

<p>And go he did.</p>

<p>By the terms of the wager, duly drawn up that evening, Cleveland was
to start from the City Hall, in New York City, at six o'clock in
the afternoon of the 10th of September, without money or any thing
of value on his person. In this condition he was to make his way to
St. Louis and from there to New Orleans, at which last named city he
was to arrive, (and make known his arrival by a telegram from the
St. Charles Hotel,) at, or before ten o'clock, A.M., City Hall time,
October the 2d, making the tramp in twenty-one days from New York, with
four hours <i>grace</i> on the 2d of October, thrown in at the suggestion
of Hough. It was further stipulated that at no time while performing
the feat, should he appeal for aid to friends, or use the influences
of relatives or name, either by reference or application, to assist
him. To recapitulate:—Benjamin Cleveland was to make his way from New
York to New Orleans, via St. Louis, in three weeks, as a penniless,
professional TRAMP!</p>

<p class="ph2">THE START.</p>


<p>On the 10th of September, the four friends had a final meeting at a
sumptuous little dinner, given at the Fourteenth Street Delmonico's, by
Smythe. At three o'clock in the afternoon the party broke up, with one
last toast to the success of our friend's undertaking.</p>

<p>As the hands of the City Hall clock pointed the hour of six that
evening, Smythe, Hough, and Wasson, with a number of friends who had
been informed of the wager, shook hands with Ben on the steps of the
City Hall and bade him <i>bon voyage</i>. A minute after, when the hives
of the great metropolis were turning loose their human bees, and the
streets were swarming with released humanity, homeward bound, Benjamin
Cleveland walked down Courtlandt Street, with his hands in his empty
pockets—feeling as he never felt before in all his life—A TRAMP!</p>

<p>Reader were you ever "broke"? Do you remember ever to have found
yourself without money and without the possibility of getting it?
If so, you will not surely have to tax your memory to recall the
circumstance. The feeling of utter helplessness you then experienced
will be indelibly stamped on your mind—fresh and green for a life
time. You were in the world, yet not of it. You were a part and parcel
of humanity, yet held nothing in common with it. Your mind wandered
from subject to subject, and from proposition to proposition, in a
dazed, uncontrolled manner that left your physical nature without a
guide. How empty every thing seemed. All you met appeared to look right
into your pockets and discover the horrible truth. The commonest mortal
with a home and an occupation became a prince of peace and plenty in
your eyes. And then the ever occurring, never answered, eternally
harassing question that was constantly forcing itself upon you in a
thousand shapes, "What shall I do?" You truly felt how small, petty
and insignificant a thing man is without money. A nonentity; a cipher;
a NOTHING! A shadow of existence—an effigy of immortality. Then
the desperate thoughts that came ploughing along, tumbling over one
another, and frantically appealing to you, for the action you did not
possess. Was it not horrible! The dark deeds that pictured themselves
to you. The wild promptings to some desperate act. How you <i>hated</i> your
fellow man. <i>He was not your fellow man!</i> He was a being belonging
to altogether a different sphere than yours. There was no fellowship
about it. You were an Ishmaelite, and there was a savage satisfaction
in feeling that all the world had its hand raised against you, and
yours against all the world. Indeed, to tell the truth, you were not
far from desperate deeds. The step from poverty to crime is a short
one,—if poverty, <i>itself</i>, be not a crime. A man without money feels
an ownership in every one else's property. An ownership where Might
becomes the agent of Possession. You felt it. And perhaps it was more
a lack of opportunity than inclination that kept you from becoming a
criminal. Then do you remember the vows you made, "if you could only
once get out of this fix!" The vices you intended to shun; the economy
you would practice; the practical and substantial sympathy you would
have for all forlorn mortals in your present predicament? The virtues
of industry, perseverance and prudence you would religiously follow?</p>

<p>Bah!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"When the devil was sick, the devil a saint would be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the devil got well, the devil a saint was he."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But perchance you have been "broke" more than once. Several times
it may be. Vices, carelessness and a peculiar faculty for getting
rid of money have reduced you to the predicament frequently. It has
become normal. Do you dread it? No. It has lost its horrors. You have
discovered that a man who starves in this country commits suicide. You
have also learned how to let your self-respect have a half-holiday.
Rags have become familiar to you and wear easily. You have learned to
ask that you may receive. To knock at the door that the purse of the
party within may be opened unto you. And, withal, there is a sort of
freedom in the situation that is agreeable. The conventionalities of
society have no claim upon you. You are beholden to no one, and no one
to you. As free as the winds to come and go, work or play, sing or
howl—in fact, <i>to do as you please</i>! Stocks up or stocks down—it is
all the same. Banks may go into liquidation, and insurance companies
only insure a loss. What do you care? The president may go to Canada
and the cashier to Europe, and all available funds go along with them.
Bah! Let the galled jade wince, your withers are unwrung. They have
none of <i>your</i> money. The woes of others are your <i>diversion</i>. The
Silver Bill a football in the Senate; Congressman Western Windy's
anti-tariff resolution; the monthly statement of the National debt;
the four per cent. loan;—you pass them by with supreme contempt. If
the country were placed on its financial head to-morrow, kicking its
heels amid the clouds of bankruptcy, it would be a matter of the most
delightful indifference to you. The pinnacle of your hopes, aspirations
and desires may be realized in that ecstatic moment, when, filled to
the chin at the hospitable hands of some charitable housewife, you
recline at ease on the sunny side of a plank and contemplate life
through the hazy, somnolent contentment of a full stomach, without a
care to oppress you!</p>

<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, (as the case may be considered by the
reader) Benjamin Cleveland illustrated neither of these phases of
impecuniosity as he walked down Courtlandt Street.</p>

<p>True, he was moneyless,—and for the first time in his life. But
his was a voluntary exile into poverty, and he had the stimulus of
an object. There was something to be attained; something to strive
for;—an object in life.</p>

<p>And a life without an object is death in masquerade.</p>

<p>One magical name was constantly in his mind. The name of the goal:—New
Orleans.</p>

<p>What his sensations were as he walked toward the Jersey City Ferry
would be hard to analyze. He felt somewhat sheepish and shame-faced.
Every one passing seemed to take a personal interest in him, and say,
"Ah, we know you. We know what you are doing. We know you have no
money. <i>You are a tramp!</i>" He could have sworn that such were their
thoughts. To be sure it was all imagination. They were all doing
exactly as he was—thinking of themselves. The world rarely pays any
attention to you unless you tread on its toes. Plunge your finger into
the ocean—withdraw it—look for the hole! The ocean is the world—the
hole yourself. Ben felt <i>queer</i>. The central figure of his thoughts was
New Orleans. But the steps between New York and New Orleans were many,
and he was but taking the initial one.</p>

<p>While dreaming of the future he suddenly came plump up against the
present in the shape of the Jersey City Ferry toll house. Forgetting
for the moment the empty character of his exchequer, he entered the
gate and thrust his hand in his pocket for the requisite toll.</p>

<p>The pocket was empty!</p>

<p>Blushing at his forgetfulness, and stammering out something to the toll
collector about having left all his change at home, Ben retreated from
the gate and into the street again.</p>

<p>It was his first check. The first gate on his road. And to tell the
truth he felt lost. Here was only two cents standing between himself
and $20,000! Ridiculous! Nevertheless a very substantial fact.</p>

<p>For half an hour he loafed up and down the piers of the North River,
wondering what he should do. Once it suggested itself to him to go back
to his friends and acknowledge the attempt a failure. But he thrust the
thought aside as cowardly. Go he would, though he had to swim to the
opposite shore, or go up to Albany and walk around the river!</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.</p>


<p>While Ben reflected upon the majesty and power of two cents, seated on
a check post, he was approached by a seedy individual, who had been
hovering in this vicinity eyeing him stealthily, for some time.</p>

<p>"Mister," said the stranger, "would you be kind enough to help a man
a little. I'm broke, and I'm sick. I have a wife and four children in
Philadelphia. I'm a shoemaker by trade, and if I could once get back
home, I'd get work; and, on my word and honor I'll send you any money
you let me have."</p>

<p>Ben thought of his own utter financial emptiness and smiled. The man
thought he doubted his integrity, and hastily promised:</p>

<p>"I'll do it, so help me! I had all my money stolen from me by a man
that I befriended, who said he had no place to stop. I've been trying
for work for two weeks and a starving to death a doing of it. I'll—"</p>

<p>"Hold on," interrupted Ben, "I am sorry for you but I have not a single
cent myself."</p>

<p>The man looked incredulous.</p>

<p>"It is a fact," continued Cleveland. "I want to go to New Orleans, and
here I am stopped for want of two cents with which to cross this ferry."</p>

<p>"What, you broke with all them good clothes on!" exclaimed the
shoemaker in astonishment.</p>

<p>Ben thought he was dressed very shabbily, having donned the oldest and
coarsest suit he owned, but in the eyes of the dilapidated shoemaker he
was, undoubtedly, arrayed like unto a lily of the field. He answered
however:</p>

<p>"I tell you the actual truth, my friend. I have not one cent myself."</p>

<p>"Have you had any thing to eat? Are you hungry?" asked the shoemaker,
thrusting his hand into a breast pocket and producing a package of cold
victuals wrapped up in a dirty piece of old newspaper.</p>

<p>Ben looked surprised at this generosity on the part of one who a moment
before had confessed himself as starving to death, but refrained from
expressing his thoughts as he declined the proffered food.</p>

<p>"You've got along well for chuck, then," remarked the shoemaker,
returning the package to his pocket.</p>

<p>Ben had a dim comprehension that "chuck" referred to food, and replied
that he was not hungry, adding the information that he was only
recently become "broke" and that it was the first time in his life such
a predicament had overtaken him; whereupon the shoemaker looked at him
with commiseration. Indeed he appeared so to sympathize with Ben that
that young gentleman was touched, and said:</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry I have not something to give you, for I know how a
man in your position must feel, having a wife and four children at a
distance and no money to reach them with." But this was not received
graciously by the knight of St. Crispin, who looked at Ben suspiciously
and gruffly said:</p>

<p>"What are you giving us;—lumps?"</p>

<p>Ben was at a loss for the meaning of "lumps" but answered pleasantly:</p>

<p>"I was speaking of your family; your wife and four children in
Philadelphia." This was said so honestly that the man's face cleared up
in a moment, and he broke into a coarse laugh.</p>

<p>"Philadelphia be blowed! This town's too fat to leave. Big free
lunches. Five cent hang ups. Best town to codge in you ever struck!
Give you a reg'lar sit down here. Philadelphia you only get a back
door hand-out. Down there they allus think you're after the spoons and
cutlery. Don't care a durn what you are after here. All of 'em after
sumthin' themselves. All politicians here. Tell 'em you belongs to
the Ward. Find out what ward you're in first. Give you big squares.
Sometimes wealth—and clo'es. Give you a copper cent in Philadelphia,
and make you go before a justice of the peace and swear you won't
spend it for drink. <i>Here</i>, don't care a cuss what you spend it
for. Philadelphia the lady of the house comes down to see you and
ask questions. <i>Here</i>, the servant girl's boss! If she's Irish, say
you're a Fenian. If she's Dutch, tell her you've got a sauerkraut
wife. If she's a nigger, just tell her you're hungry. Go striking in
Philadelphia and they'll hand you over to the police. Strike a man here
and he's <i>white</i>! Give him a stiff on some good trade. But look out
you don't get caught up. I struck a man this mornin' and give him that
I was a blacksmith. Thunder! What you suppose! He took me about six
blocks, up to where he lived over his own shop, and give me a big sit
down. Then he took me down to the shop and told me he'd give me work
for the next three months, and wanted me to go right to business! I
pulled off my coat and let on that I'd struck oil at last, an' then, of
a sudden, told him I'd a keyster down at a hang up with a leather apron
in it, an' I'd have to go after it. He wanted to lend me an apron, but
I told him I was so used to this one that I could not work without it
nohow.</p>

<p>"You see you must be careful who you strike. But I s'pects you're a
fresh one. Now take my advice: unless there's big inducements taking
you to New Orleans, don't you leave this town. You're well dressed,
an' you look well. Why, with those togs on, and that light over-Benny
you can beat the restaurants and lunches for the next twelve months!
Tramping aint what it used to be. It's overdone. There's too many
working at the business. There's no money in it. You stay here."</p>

<p>Though Ben did not more than half understand what the whilom shoemaker
had been saying, he nevertheless realized that he was conversing with
a professional parasite,—one of those social excrescences, so many of
which are to be found in all large cities. He thanked him, however,
for the kind interest He took in his welfare, but reiterated his
determination to go to New Orleans.</p>

<p>"Then go by boat. Beat your way on a steamer. Stow away, and when
they're off once they can't land you except they run into Havana."</p>

<p>"But I want to go to St. Louis first," said Ben.</p>

<p>"St. Louis is a good town. You hear <i>me</i>! The soup season aint
commenced yet. But they set boss free lunches!" And the professional
rolled his eyes as he mentioned the delights of the Future Great City.</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged to you for the information, I'm sure," replied Ben.
"But what troubles me just at present is to cross this ferry."</p>

<p>"To cross the ferry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Poh! That's the easiest thing in the world. Go give 'em a racket. Go
to the wagon gate, I would. The box man's too busy to attend to you.
Tell the man there you just had your pocket picked and must get over
in time to catch the Elizabeth train. Tell him you'll pay him when you
come back in the morning. Your clothes will carry you through." And the
shoemaker smiled on Ben's wardrobe approvingly.</p>

<p>"Thanks for your advice; but to be frank, I had rather not tell what is
not so."</p>

<p>The eyes of the professional opened to their widest extent.</p>

<p>"Gosh! Where'd you say you were a going? New Orleans! Well, mebbe
you'll get there—mebbe not. See here, was that a stiff you was givin'
me?"</p>

<p>Ben replied that he did not fully comprehend what a "stiff" might be,
but he assured his interlocutor that he was sincere relative to a due
regard for the truth.</p>

<p>The shoemaker was evidently puzzled. He could not understand the moral
that could prevent a man from attaining a convenience within the reach
of a lie. But his astonishment was tinctured with a respect for a
virtue he could not comprehend.</p>

<p>"It's all right, I s'pose," he remarked, "but it's <i>too</i> funny for me.
You're the first man I ever met that wouldn't tell whatever suited
him to get along easy. Why, look-a-here; you go up and tell that gate
keeper you're bust, and want to go over. He'll laugh at you. Look on
you with contempt. Go tell him you live in Newark, and have just had
your pocket picked. He'll respect you, and treat you civilly, whether
he believes you or not; ten to one he'll let you over. Lemme tell you
somethin' as may be useful to you on your way. There's no premiums for
truth, but there's an everlasting lot of chromos goes with good lies.
Now if it's agin your conscience to gin the gate keeper a racket, the
only other way I know for you to get over is to go up the street a
piece and jump a wagon. Gin the driver a good talk, and get him to take
you. So long, my friend. I wish you luck. The band's about to play
over in the Bowery, an' if I aint on hand in time, some unprincipled
vagabond will have my dress-circle seat with a lamppost back. So long!"
And shaking Ben by the hand, the shoemaker turned and disappeared up a
neighboring thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Ignoring the professional's moral advice, our friend proceeded a short
distance from the ferry, and meeting a jovial, round-faced Hibernian,
driving a dray, told his desire to go over, and the impecunious
position in which he was placed. The driver kindly gave him a lift,
and the gate was safely passed. On the ferry, Ben answered the driver's
numerous inquiries as explicitly as he thought proper, and quite an
acquaintance was struck between them. When the boat had deposited them
on the Jersey City side he dismounted, and after thanking the driver
was about proceeding on his way, when the latter thrust out a dirty,
toil soiled hand, and forced a quarter of a dollar on him. "It aint
much, but it'll help yez get a mouthful to eat," and without waiting
either protestations or thanks, the man put whip to his team and drove
off.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">OUR HERO MEETS HIS DESTINY.</p>


<p>"Well, it <i>is</i> charity," said Ben to himself, "but it is acceptable for
all that." He then strolled up the gaslit street,—for it had been dark
for some little time—and repeatedly asked himself what would be the
next move in the campaign he had undertaken.</p>

<p>The "prodigal" had spoken of riding; how was it to be done? Should he
enter a train, take a seat and wait until the conductor put him off? He
knew that that manner of proceeding would gain him but a short ride.
Perhaps he might tell the conductor a pathetic tale that would so work
upon that individual's generosity that he would allow him to continue
on the train. Alas, he knew the craft too well to attempt so futile an
undertaking. Not that conductors are a hard-hearted class of persons,
but their orders are strict, and permitting a free ride would subject
them to a peremptory discharge. In fact Ben was lost. At a distance
the simple matter of going from place to place looked easy enough of
accomplishment, but now that he was brought face to face with the
problem its solution became a difficult (indeed he was about thinking
an impossible) task. What to do or where to go he knew not. For a time
he gazed listlessly into the shop windows, and mechanically strolled
along. If he could only meet a tramp, he thought, he would ask him how
to proceed; and he kept a sharp lookout for one of the fraternity, but
none presented themselves. It soon grew late, and the streets lonely.
The pedestrians became fewer and fewer, and the shops, one by one, put
up their shutters. Ben thought he had never felt so lonesome in all
his life; and he was right. There is no situation in life more lonely,
than to be alone in a great city at night fall. In the woods a man
has Nature to listen to and commune with. On the prairies there are
the stars and the night breeze for companions. But in a metropolis, a
stranger among our fellow men, such a wretched, helpless feeling comes
over the traveller that his loneliness seats itself, not only on his
mind, but on his heart. This feeling was creeping with a dull, heavy
tread upon Ben, and he had already commenced to anxiously question
himself where he should pass the night that was now surrounding him,
when his attention was suddenly aroused by a youthful voice, in a dark
side street, close by, crying out:</p>

<p>"Let me alone! Let me alone, I say!" and then a gentle female voice
entreating:</p>

<p>"Do not strike the boy, Arthur. Do not beat him. He did not mean to; I
am sure he did not!"</p>

<p>"I'll teach you to pick a pocket, you young scoundrel!" exclaimed an
angry man; and there followed a blow, and a cry of pain.</p>

<p>By this time Ben, who had accelerated his step, reached the scene of
disturbance, and discovered by the dim light that crept from a street
lamp, half a block away, a large man grasping a boy by the arm, and
holding an uplifted cane, that a young lady was striving to prevent
again descending upon the captive. The face of the latter being
concealed by an old slouch hat jammed down over his eyes.</p>

<p>In Ben's nature was a strong love of justice. He had ever been a
champion of the weak, and an injury inflicted by a strong arm on one
incapable of resistance was an outrage on his own sensitiveness, that
had involved him in many a rough-and-tumble while a boy at school and
college. As the man shook off his fair companion's hand and the cane
was about descending again on the shrinking person of the boy, he
interposed his arm and caught the blow upon it.</p>

<p>"Don't strike the boy, sir. Please do not hit him. Even if he has done
wrong a beating will not improve him." As he thus expostulated with the
man he became conscious of a pair of great, glorious, grey eyes, that
fairly glowed in the dark, looking gratefully upon him from out the
folds of a snowy nubia, and a very melodious voice seconding his own
entreaties, with:</p>

<p>"I'm sure you are mistaken, Arthur. This gentleman is right. Pray do
not strike the boy again."</p>

<p>But Ben's observations reached no farther, for the man gave him a
stinging blow across the face with the cane, exclaiming fiercely:</p>

<p>"Confound your impudence, who asked you to interfere!" The next moment
the man lay at length in the gutter, having been sent there by a
powerful and well directed blow with which, in the heat of the moment,
Ben had resented the indignity received by him.</p>

<p>The next instant he repented such an act in the presence of a lady
and turned to apologize, when a warning voice cried, "Look out! He is
armed!" and he saw that his opponent had regained his feet and was
drawing a weapon from his pocket. What the result might have been, had
the man been allowed to use his revolver, is not difficult to surmise.
A shot at such close quarters would probably have suddenly terminated
Ben's tramp, had not the boy who gave the warning struck the man on the
head with a stone before he had an opportunity to use the weapon he was
uncovering. The blow was a severe one, and felled him senseless to the
pavement.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" cried the boy, "Let us get away from here!"</p>

<p>But Ben would not leave his fallen enemy without ascertaining the
extent of his injuries, and he immediately offered his assistance to
the young lady, who now stood beside her senseless escort, wringing her
hands, and vainly imploring him to arise. He had been only stunned,
however, and as Ben stooped over him showed signs of returning
consciousness. Attempting to rise to his feet, he found himself still
too dazed from the effects of the blow, and would have fallen had not
Cleveland supported him.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry this should have occurred, Miss, but realty this
gentleman is alone responsible for it," said Ben apologetically.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied graciously. "No doubt you are right, sir. I do not
think the boy intended any wrong, but—but Arthur was ill tempered on
account of other matters, and—allowed his anger to vent itself on the
first object it came across."</p>

<p>And Ben thought he noticed, that, though nervous from the excitement,
she did not appear to evince much sympathy for her companion. The
latter soon recovered his senses sufficiently to keep his feet, and
supporting himself by the young lady's arm prepared to leave. As he was
moving off he turned upon Ben and said, with a malevolent scowl: "I
will remember you, sir."</p>

<p>"I trust, miss, you will pardon me for my rudeness," said our hero,
addressing the young lady and ignoring her companion. "I am very sorry
for what has occurred. Here is his pistol. I hope the next time he
draws it, it will be in defence of a more manly action than striking
one too small to defend himself." And he handed the revolver to the
young lady, who received it with a simple "thank you, sir." Ben
lifted his hat courteously, and the fair one returned a smile and an
inclination of her head; and the three separated.</p>

<p>Our friend stood watching the retreating figures of the lady and her
escort, until they were lost in the darkness, and then, instead of
resuming his walk, he leaned against a neighboring wall, while his
thoughts continued to follow the owner of the great, glorious, gray
eyes in the nubia.</p>

<p>Unconscious of his surroundings, his mind basked in the light of the
bewildering glances, and his ears danced to the music of the voice
that had proceeded from out the folds of the snowy nubia. Ben had
a large circle of young lady acquaintances, and, being a fellow of
culture and good looks, was a favorite with the fair sex. Among them
might have been numbered many attractive and <i>polished</i> misses, some of
whom had treated our hero more than cordially. But for all he retained
the same simple feeling of friendship,—and, nothing deeper. There was
a latent feeling in the young man's composition that had never been
touched until that evening. A wonderful change had now come over him.
He felt that she of the nubia was a fragment (and a pretty large one)
of his own existence. And it is singular, yet true, should he never
again have set eyes upon her, there would have remained for life a
tender memory in his heart that nothing could have displaced.</p>

<p>There is many a heart, going about this world to-day, with just such an
uncompleted vision, locked up as a sacred secret within.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he said to himself, "we probably will never meet again." At
the same time there was a small voice, aiding and abetting a sanguine
hope, which kept saying: "Yes you will, Ben. Depend upon it, you will,
my boy!"</p>

<p>Happening to look up from his musings, he discovered the cause of the
recent encounter standing a few feet away, attentively observing him.
The lad, finding his presence noticed, approached closer and said in a
singularly soft, pleasant voice:</p>

<p>"I thank you ever so much. I chanced to run against that man in the
dark, and he called me a thief. I called him a liar. Then he struck
me. I'm no <i>thief</i>!"</p>

<p>"Do you know the man?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>There was considerable hesitancy in the boy's manner as he answered:
"No—no—I don't know him. But I <i>will</i>, if I see him again, and I
won't forget that he struck me, either."</p>

<p>"I wish you knew him," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the other in surprise.</p>

<p>Ben blushed all to himself in the dark, but, reasoning that it was
"only a boy," boldly answered:</p>

<p>"I should like to know whom his lady companion is."</p>

<p>"Oh! Is <i>that</i> it!" and the way he said it sounded singular to Ben.
"Well, I suppose you live here and will have a chance to find out."</p>

<p>"No, I do not live here. I live in New York."</p>

<p>"Going home to-night?" inquired the lad.</p>

<p>"No," laughed Ben. "I'm going to St. Louis before I go home again."</p>

<p>"To St. Louis! I declare! There is where I'm going myself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may travel together," suggested Ben, laughing.</p>

<p>"No fear of that," replied the other. "I guess my way of travelling
wouldn't suit you. I go in a Pullman Palace box car," and the boy
laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"A what car?"</p>

<p>"A Pullman Palace Box!" returned the boy. "I'm going to beat my way."</p>

<p>At last, thought Ben, I see a way out of the woods!</p>

<p>"Are you indeed! That is identically the way I am going to travel. Do
you think you can get to St. Louis?"</p>

<p>"Get there!" exclaimed the patron of the palace box disdainfully. "Get
there! Well, I should say, I have just made it from Boston here, and I
made it from Montreal to Boston. I know all the ropes, now;—sure as
you live, I do. And are you broke too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Cleveland; "and that is not the worst of it. I never was
broke before, and, to tell the truth, I'm a novice at beating my way,
and do not know just how to do it."</p>

<p>"Why, so far as that goes, beating one's way is like any other kind of
work. <i>It is work.</i> To be sure it's not quite so pleasant as <i>paying</i>
your way, and you have to put up with a good bit, but if you have the
nerve you may rest assured that you will get to your destination all
right. As we are going the same way, suppose we go together?"</p>

<p>"Agreed!" said Ben, glad to have fallen in with some one posted in the
vagabond life he was about entering upon.</p>

<p>"Then we're pards. Here's my hand on it!" and Ben grasped a warm, soft
hand in his and the compact was duly signed and sealed.</p>

<p>"Now, partner," said the boy, "as you say you are new to the business,
let me have the direction of affairs until you get your hand in. We
will have to stay here for to-night, because the yards and tracks are
watched so close that it is next to impossible to jump a train going
out of here. But to-morrow we will foot it down to Elizabeth, and
make some side track below that town, and jump a train in the evening.
To-morrow night, by this time, we can make Philadelphia. That will be a
good time to jump some coal flats and get out on the Central road."</p>

<p>"You speak as though you had been over the route," said Ben in
admiration of the practical manner in which his new acquaintance
handled the subject. He felt a great relief in having found a companion
who could tell him something about travelling in the new style, not at
that time being aware of the fact that had he followed the railroad he
could have picked up a score of free-riders going in any direction his
fancy may have desired.</p>

<p>The boy, however, denied having ever been over the road before.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, "when you are on a tramp you learn to post yourself
on these matters. It's easy done;—see here! Here's the public and
employee's time-tables of all the roads that come into New York City."
And he showed Ben a pocket-full of railroad time-tables. "With these
you can keep posted just how the trains run, where there are good
jumping places, tanks, switches, and so on. All the bums carry them.
They are their <i>war maps</i>. At the next convention the tramps ought
to vote a set of thanks to the railroad companies for printing these
things for them. But now let's go to bed. Have you any wealth?"</p>

<p>"I have just twenty-five cents," replied Ben acknowledging the quarter
given him by the teamster.</p>

<p>"Good enough. Keep your money for tobacco. Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"All right then. We will get some breakfast before we start in the
morning. Now let us go to bed. I've got the boss hangup. It's a shed
in a lumber-yard. There's lots of nice clean boards in it. You must go
quiet, or the watchman will see us getting in, though, after you get in
the shed he never comes by that way. Come on."</p>

<p>Ben followed the boy to a lumber-yard, and having scaled a padlocked
gate, they were about to make for the shed, which was dimly discernible
in the distance, when the quick ear of the lad detected footsteps.
Quietly he led Ben into a recess, made by projecting piles of lumber,
and then the two crouched down, awaiting the appearance of the person
approaching. That individual shortly came up in the shape of a man—and
a very ragged one—as seen through the starlight. Behind him limped a
comrade carrying a small bundle. They were outside of the fence, and
halted when they arrived at the gate.</p>

<p>"Let's get in here, Billy," said the foremost in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, thunder, Peters! My foot's too sore to climb that there fence, and
if a dog got after us on the other side, I'd be gone up. Let's go to
the Station-house and have a good-night's rest."</p>

<p>"I tell you I aint agoing to the police station, like a slouch,"
replied he addressed as Peters.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're so durned high toned!" muttered 'Billy.' "There's as good
men goes to the station as you be, and if you get over into that yard
somebody may catch you and hand you over, and then you'd go up for a
vag for sixty days, mebbe. I wish we'd a camped out in the country and
not come in town to-night."</p>

<p>"We <i>had</i> to come in to get some snipes. You said you was a dying for
a smoke. Come now, and shin over." And 'Peters' commenced scaling the
gate, when Ben's companion called out:</p>

<p>"Get away from this yard, you scoundrels, or I'll give you over!"</p>

<p>A sudden fall from the gate, was followed by a hasty shuffling of feet,
and the boy said to Ben:</p>

<p>"All right, now. We have got rid of them. This is my hangup, for I
discovered it, and I don't want any more lodgers. Come on."</p>

<p>When they were safely stowed away on the planks under the shed, Ben
asked:</p>

<p>"Were those tramps?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other; "peach-plucks, I s'pose. The country's full
of them."</p>

<p>"What are 'peach-plucks'?"</p>

<p>"Fellows that tramp up and down Delaware and Jersey during the
peach season. They get work at from fifty cents to a dollar a day,
picking peaches. Sleep out on the ground and live on corn-dodgers and
sow-belly. It's a star time with the bums, and I suppose there's five
thousand or more of them ramble through the peach country. You see work
aint heavy and they can have all the peaches to eat they want."</p>

<p>"But I should think that even at those small wages they might earn
enough to keep them until they found better employment," said Ben.</p>

<p>"They're not after employment; they're out for an airing, and only work
two or three days at a time. After the peaches play out, lots of 'em
strike off through the country for the Wisconsin hop yards, where men
and women pick in the fields together, and dance all night. It is the
life they like. Money's no object. Let us go to sleep so that we can
get up early." And he lay down at full length on the boards as though
they were a bed of down. Ben followed his example; but the strangeness
of his new position kept him long awake, thinking thoughts that had
never before visited his mind. Once he gave his companion a gentle
push, and asked:</p>

<p>"Boy, what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Tommy."</p>

<p>"Tommy, what are 'snipes'?"</p>

<p>"Cigar butts!" and Tommy laughed a sleepy little laugh, and was soon
thereafter snoring.</p>

<p>Then came the sweet angel Sleep, and wrapped his arms around city and
woodland, palace and hovel, police station and lumber pile, and took
his weary devotees off on a tour through dreamland.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning, Ben awoke shivering with cold. The
damp night air, warm enough in the early evening, had chilled and
aroused him. His restlessness startled Tommy who enquired what the
matter was.</p>

<p>"Ah, you were not tired enough to sleep sound." And then Tommy showed
him how to make a blanket of his coat and vest, by covering up his head
with the coat and rolling the other up on the breezy side of him, and
in a few moments Ben felt himself quite warm, and again dozed off.</p>

<p>That trick of making a blanket out of his coat and covering up his head
so as to retain all the heat of respiration was a valuable one that he
often thereafter made use of.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">OUR HERO EATS THE BREAD OF CHARITY.</p>


<p>Bright and early, on the following morning, our two tramps deserted
the lumber-yard, and having found a pump, both performed their morning
ablutions; Ben feeling a trifle stiff in the neighborhood of the spots
where his bed rubbed him the heaviest. But relying on Tommy's assertion
that he would soon view a clean plank as a positive luxury, he made no
complaints.</p>

<p>"And now for breakfast!" said Tom. "Then we will start."</p>

<p>Never before had this matter of breakfast appeared of such magnitude
to Ben. It was as natural for him to eat breakfast of a morning as
to exist. It is so with thousands of good people. And yet there are
many persons in the world who are ofttimes compelled to look upon a
matutinal meal as an unattainable luxury, and respect it accordingly.</p>

<p>Tommy's cheerful invitation was somewhat reassuring, however. The two
walked on in silence until they were well out in the suburbs of the
city, when the boy turning to Ben, said:</p>

<p>"This will do. Now you are hungry, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>He did not deny the soft impeachment. Indeed his well regulated
interior had clamored loudly the previous evening at the enforced fast
imposed upon it, and was now sternly calling upon its provider to do
his duty, and his whole duty, like a man.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," instructed Tommy. "You are young at cadging and I will
have to give you some points."</p>

<p>Ben not only gave an attentive ear but he took a good look at his
companion in the broad daylight. The boy might have been fourteen or
fifteen years of age; a round, plump little fellow, with a merry face,
and sparkling, hazel eyes shaded by long, black lashes. There was
something girlish in his cheek, it was so round, and smooth, and rosy,
without the slightest sign of those capillary advantages that manhood's
prime was to decorate it with. An ungovernable mass of curly black hair
straggled from under a well worn slouch hat that had bronzed beneath
sun and storm, and become limp and shapeless in its career of pillow
and basket. When Tommy spoke his voice had a clear, silvery ring, quite
pleasant to the ear; and when he laughed he showed a dazzling set of
teeth. Such was Ben's new companion. He looked as though he might be a
good boy who would do many a bad trick.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said. "We must get breakfast right off. You take that side
of the street, and I'll take this. Go to the back doors and tell them
any sort of a tale that comes handy; only don't forget to say, every
time, that this is the first time you have ever had to ask for such
a thing in your life, and that you scorn to accept it as a charity,
but want to earn what you eat, and you would like to saw wood enough
for your breakfast. But before you knock be sure you look around and
see that they use coal. We have no time to fool away manufacturing
firewood. Now go on, and we will meet down at the corner of the next
block; the one that gets there first, to wait for the other."</p>

<p>Of all forlorn mortals, Benjamin Cleveland felt at that moment the
most forlorn. He could have charged a battery, where there was no
chance of coming back alive, cheerfully. He could have ventured any
desperate deed that required mere physical courage; but to go into a
house and beg for something to eat,—he could not! His heart jumped
to his throat with all the nervous energy that attends physical fear
in men differently constituted from our hero. Gate after gate was
passed, he persuading and promising himself that the next one should
surely be entered. Once he <i>did stop</i> with his hand on a latch, but
chancing to look up at the house he saw a little boy eyeing him from an
upper window, and retreated completely vanquished. It required all his
stubbornness and constant thoughts of New Orleans to prevent his giving
up the projected "tramp" there and then, and acknowledging himself a
failure. What was $20,000 to such humiliation!</p>

<p>But another course of reasoning came to his aid: "You call it <i>pride</i>,
Ben; but are mistaken. It's lack of <i>nerve</i>, my boy," said this new
logician. "There is as much nerve required in facing humiliations as
there is in facing a battery. <i>More</i>, sometimes. <i>Physically</i> brave
men are plentiful. It is <i>mental</i> bravery that is lacking in you and
thousands of others. To be sure it is low. It is humiliating. It is
<i>begging</i>. You will be a beggar. But you have an object to attain, and
it can only be attained the one way. It is either do it, or surrender!"</p>

<p>This sophistry at last wrought so upon him that closing his eyes upon
all surroundings, he made a blind dash at a gate, and without allowing
himself time to think hurried around to the mansion's back door, at
which he was actually knocking before he fully understood himself, and
without once remembering Tommy's injunction to be careful and satisfy
himself that there was no obnoxious wood-pile in the vicinity.</p>

<p>A man answered his knock, and all his courage immediately oozed out.
If it had only been a woman, he thought, it would have been different.
But how could he ask a man for something to eat! He could not, and he
did not, but stammering out some irrelevant inquiry about an imaginary
Mr. Brown, he blushed and looked decidedly sheepish. The man, eyeing
him suspiciously, replied that no Mr. Brown lived there, or in that
neighborhood, and shut the door in his face.</p>

<p>Poor Ben made his way to the sidewalk feeling smaller than ever in his
life. Truly if the $20,000 is to be earned at this price it will be
dear enough; and he had not the heart to make another back door appeal,
but walked to the appointed rendezvous, and there awaited Tommy.</p>

<p>That young gentleman shortly appeared, smacking his lips, and looking
as well fed and contented as possible.</p>

<p>"I had a splendid breakfast! Mutton chops, hot waffles, fried potatoes,
scrambled eggs, coffee,—oh my eye, such coffee! Three cups of it! Oh!"
and Tommy, his vocabulary unable to furnish him with adjectives to do
full justice to the merits of the coffee, rolled his eyes instead,
little knowing the misery his bill of fare was giving poor empty
stomached Ben.</p>

<p>"What did you have, partner?"</p>

<p>Ben very truthfully remarked that he had had a light breakfast, indeed
not much of any thing to speak of.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you go into another house and keep agoing until you're
full?" asked Tommy. "Go back where I was and tell them I sent you.
There's lots left."</p>

<p>But this proposition was viewed unfavorably by Mr. Cleveland, who
remarked that he was not <i>very</i> hungry, (which was false) and that he
would purchase a nickel's worth of crackers, which would fill him to
repletion.</p>

<p>"Do as you please," replied his companion, "but I advise you not to
spend your money foolishly. You can get all the chuck you want, by
asking for it, and can save your money for newspapers and tobacco—and
(reflectively) hair grease."</p>

<p>Ben persisted in the extravagance of a nickel's worth of crackers,
however, and when he had eaten them, felt much better. He also
purchased a dime's worth of tobacco, some of which he offered Tommy,
who refused the weed.</p>

<p>The two now took to the railroad, and late in the afternoon made a
water tank and side track below Elizabeth, where the time table "For
employees only," informed them many trains would stop to water and
pass, during the night.</p>

<p>On the walk down the track, Tommy had made numerous excursions to
houses along the lines for "hand-outs." He met with much success and
nearly always returned with something. Sometimes with bread, sometimes
bread and meat, and once a lot of soft rice pudding, carefully conveyed
in his hat; all of which he shared with Ben, and when they had more
than they needed, gave to other tramps whom they met. They passed
several of these gentry on their way north-east. At such a meeting, all
hands would squat on the rails and a long confab ensue. There were two
questions always asked by those they met. One was, "How's 'times' where
you fellows come from?" and the other, "How's grub on the road?" All of
them professed to be in search of work; which, no doubt, the majority
honestly were, but work is at present a very scarce article in the
United States.</p>

<p>These tramps either preferred walking, or had been recently "bounced"
from trains on which they were stealing rides. Hardly any took to
the country roads,—save it might have been in the vicinity of a
town,—much preferring the railroads, from which fact they have derived
the sobriquet of "cross-tie sailors." Once while Ben was sitting on a
pile of ties, awaiting Tommy's return from a foray into a neighboring
farm house, he heard his name called, and looking in the direction
of the house saw Tom vigorously beckoning him. A plump, kind faced,
motherly housewife gave him a pleasant greeting, and on a bench he saw
spread an appetizing banquet of bread, butter, milk and apple sauce, to
which his little friend was energetically devoting himself. Ben needed
no persuasion to follow his example; the good dame, meanwhile, standing
by, and condoling with them.</p>

<p>"I have a son at sea, myself," said she, "and Heaven watch over my
dear boy! I know not when the fierce winds may shipwreck him among
strangers. God, forbid, though. You, young men, should be thankful that
it is no worse. And don't forget to thank Him who did it for extending
his protecting hand to you."</p>

<p>This was all not quite so lucid as Greek to Ben, who judiciously
replied in monosyllables, as he devoured the food. On leaving, their
kind hostess presented them with a large package of bread and ham.</p>

<p>When they regained the track, Tommy explained that he had given the
good lady "quite a racket." The "racket" proved to be a pathetic tale
of shipwreck in which the two tramps had taken a prominent part, having
recently landed destitute in New York City, from thence they were
making their way on foot to their homes in Baltimore. While Ben could
not indorse the moral laxity embraced in the "racket," he nevertheless
admired the milk and apple sauce. The bread and ham made them a hearty
supper that afternoon, when they had taken to the seclusion of a small
grove near the tank and side track. After their repast, Ben was about
to remove his boots; for his feet were tired and badly chafed. Tommy
advised him not to, stating that it would be better to let his feet
"get used to it," and that they would "harden quicker" by allowing his
boots to remain on. He took them off, though, and both lay down for a
nap to strengthen them for the night's work.</p>

<p>They were soon asleep. Our hero dreamed of New Orleans and its glories.
Of bread and milk, a motherly woman and a gruff man. Of gates that
would not open, pull them ever so hard; and doors that he battered
his knuckles to pieces on without there being a response. But most he
dreamed of a pair of great, glorious, grey eyes, that, indeed, had
occupied his reflections the major portion of the day.</p>

<p>If Tommy's face indicated the thoughts passing through his mind, his
dreams were far from pleasant. He gritted his teeth, and clenched his
hands, and muttered hoarsely as he tossed about. Gradually he rolled
over on to Ben's outstretched arm. And the arm unconsciously closed
around him and drew him to Ben's bosom, on which pillowing his head,
the boy slept soundly.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">UNDER THE CYCLOPEAN EYE.</p>


<p>Ben had just knocked at a back door and a man was threatening to set
the dogs on him if he did not take himself off, and he was in the
midst of eloquent protest, that he was no tramp and was not doing this
thing from necessity, when Tommy awoke him, and he started up with
his protest but half uttered, to find the night air quite chilly, and
countless stars in the coverlet of Earth winking and blinking at him in
a most familiar manner.</p>

<p>"Get up," said Tommy. "It is ten o'clock! If you sleep that way much
longer you will talk yourself to death."</p>

<p>"Have I been talking in my sleep?" he asked sitting up with a yawn.</p>

<p>"I should say so, indeed," replied Tom. "I've been listening to you for
the past half an hour." He did not further state that during the half
hour he had bent, like a timid girl, over Ben and kissed him on cheek
and forehead—but not on the lips. But such was the fact.</p>

<p>"Come, it's ten o'clock and the freight is about due," said he.</p>

<p>"How do you know what time it is?"</p>

<p>"By my watch, of course. How else?"</p>

<p>"Have you a watch?" asked Ben, in surprise.</p>

<p>"To be sure. A splendid time piece. Been running these thousands of
years, and never yet needed repairing. There it is," and he pointed to
the Heavens.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Why up there—the Big Dipper! You can tell time by the handle of it.
Now you <i>have</i> learned something. Get up!"</p>

<p>Again on his feet he found himself quite stiff. It appeared to him as
though all of his joints were soldered together.</p>

<p>"Oh you will soon get used to that," consolingly reflected Tommy. "Bump
your back against a tree and that will shake you limber. Hi! Here she
comes! Now for it! Hurry up!" And in the distance was seen the great
Cyclopean eye of a locomotive, and the rumble of the approaching train
filled the air.</p>

<p>"Hold on Tom! I can't get on my boots," exclaimed Ben, striving to
force his swollen feet into them.</p>

<p>"We can't wait, Ben. Come on in your stockings. Carry your boots in
your hand. Hurry up! Here she is!"</p>

<p>Thus urged he limped over the rough ground with his boots in his hand.</p>

<p>"Not this side," said Tommy. "Take the other side of the track; they'll
see us here. Come, look sharp and get over before the headlight
discovers us."</p>

<p>Ben hobbled over the track and both crouched down behind a pile of old
rails on the opposite side from the tank. While cowering there the
train drew up with a rush, and a roar, and a screeching of brakes, and
stopped to fill its own tank.</p>

<p>Scarce had it come to a standstill when three figures glided like
shadows from among the cars, and swiftly ran and hid behind the pile
of rails where our friends were crouching. One of them observing them
asked, in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>"Goin' to jump her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered Tom in reply. "What's the show?"</p>

<p>"None at all," returned the other. "She's a loaded train. Every box
locked. We've been making it on the drawheads from Newark. That's your
only show."</p>

<p>Tom uttered an exclamation of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Ben, can you ride bumpers?"</p>

<p>"I think so. What are they?"</p>

<p>"Bumpers. Drawheads. The coupling between the cars. Here's three beats
riding drawheads and they say it's our only show. If you think you can,
we will try it."</p>

<p>Our hero answered that he had no experience in the business, but was
willing to make the attempt.</p>

<p>"It's death, to fall," said Tommy; and then the boy cogitated a moment,
and whispered:</p>

<p>"It won't do. You couldn't do it. Not in your stocking feet anyway.
We'll have to let this train go."</p>

<p>At this time the whistle sounded "off brakes," and the engine wheels
began to revolve. As the train got under headway, the three figures
stealthily stole forth, and plunging between the cars, the long
screeching, grinding chain of wheels, appear to roll over them and
grind them out of existence.</p>

<p>Not so, however. As the train sped away, each of the three was dangling
on that narrow, precarious, bumping, jerking little platform, made by
the links and connecting drawheads of the cars. A most dangerous place
truly, and many a tramp has left them for Eternity. A jolt! The foot
slips! A yell! And all is over. The tramp is finished.</p>

<p>But Ben discovered before he reached New Orleans that the bumpers were
not the most dangerous place about a train on which men attempted to
steal rides. When no other opportunity offers, as in the case of a
passenger train sometimes, the trucks beneath the cars are improved,
where with a constant roar in their ears, a storm of dust and gravel in
their faces, and a cramped position—like a contortionist in his box
among the bottles—these knights of vagabondage cling on like squirrels.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is an extra heavy jolt, or a larger stone than usual
strikes them on the head. In such cases the coroner's jury discover
that the man was a tramp and came to his death by being run over by the
cars. What would we do without coroner's juries?</p>

<p>Tommy watched the retreating train for some time, and then said to Ben:</p>

<p>"Never mind; better luck next time. I don't think you could have made
it on the bumpers. Here's my knife. Cut your boots so that you can
get them on. The lightning express will be along soon, and we can make
fifty or sixty miles on it. If the express car has an open end, by
thunder, we'll <i>jump the pilot</i>!"</p>

<p>"What did those men get off for?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Why," explained Tom, "when the train stops, they take to cover so that
the train men will not see them."</p>

<p>"There were three making their way on that train."</p>

<p>"Hard telling," replied Tom. "There may have been a dozen; on the
trucks, and bumpers, and hanging on the ladders; besides some that may
have forced an end gate and locked themselves in a box. When I was at
Albany, there came in a train from the west and I heard the conductor
boast that he'd made <i>one</i> trip without a deadhead. Well, Ben, when
they came to open one of the cars that had wheat in it they found a man
inside dead as a herring. He had forced the end gate and then nailed
himself in, and I expect the dust or something smothered him before he
could get it open for fresh air."</p>

<p>"That was a deadhead, sure enough. Did they find out who he was?" asked
Ben.</p>

<p>"Bless you, no. What does any one care about a dead <i>tramp</i>. I was in
hopes there'd be an empty on that train that we could have jumped, and
made it clean through to Philadelphia. Now we will have to give the
Express a whirl."</p>

<p>Ben had scarce got his boots on, after cutting them considerably, when
the express was heard thundering in the distance.</p>

<p>"Look alive now!" cried Tom. "Follow me close. She hardly stops at
all,—only just slacks up for that crossing ahead."</p>

<p>Down rushed the express on another track from the one occupied by the
freight, and as it slacked its speed near the travellers, they sprang
from their hiding place, and hugging tight to the side of the still
moving train, ran along it toward the forward end. One look at the
express car sufficed for Tom.</p>

<p>"No go!" he hurriedly whispered. "There's a door in the end. Make for
the pilot. Quick! Quick!"</p>

<p>Expedition was necessary, for the air breaks had released their grip
upon the wheels, and the train was again assuming speed.</p>

<p>Tom rushed in front of the locomotive and with a spring and a scramble,
safely seated himself on the platform immediately above and in the rear
of the pilot; or, as it is better known in schoolboy nomenclature, the
"cow-catcher."</p>

<p>Ben was not so fortunate. With a scantier knowledge of their
construction and the art of boarding them, his foot slipped from the
inclined grating and struck the fast retreating rail beneath. Another
instant and he would have been drawn down to death, had not Tommy's
hand grasped his collar and aided him up.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Tommy," he said warmly, "I owe you one."</p>

<p>"You may be able to pay me sometime. Aint this old peaches!" And
Tommy gazed on the great broad pathway of light in front, made by the
Cyclopean eye over head.</p>

<p>The novelty of his new position was exhilarating to Ben. There was a
spice of danger about it, that made it enchanting.</p>

<p>What if the locomotive should jump the track! Or should be ditched!
Or run into another train! Or strike some stray animal! It rocked and
swayed to and fro like a ship at sea. He could hardly satisfy himself
that this rattling, rickety, rocking, jumping, sliding, groaning iron
horse was the same metallic animal that pulled those easy riding,
luxurious coaches he had so often rode in. It appeared to him—novice
in locomotive riding as he was—that every moment the steel-shod steed
was about to leave the track and take to the fields. Singular too, it
was neither cold nor windy; for nestling close against the iron boiler
head both felt quite comfortable.</p>

<p>"Tommy," said Ben, "suppose we should catch up a horse?"</p>

<p>"Then we'd be a horse ahead," replied Tom. "I met a tramp who had taken
a ride on a cow-catcher on the New York Central. He was bound for
Buffalo. Well sir, they caught up a big pig, and landed it all unhurt,
but terribly scared, right into the tramp's lap. He hung on to it, and
when he got the bounce, he took the pig with him and sold it for enough
to pay his fare to Buffalo."</p>

<p>"And bought a ticket out of his hog speculation?" suggested Ben.</p>

<p>"Of course not. He went on a big spree, got broke again, and beat his
way through."</p>

<p>Ben was about protesting against such a misappliance of the means good
fortune had placed at the tramp's disposal, when the current of his
thoughts was radically changed, by a lump of coal striking him on the
foot.</p>

<p>"Hello! What's that?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment and I'll see," said Tommy, rising and peering over the
rim of the boiler. Scarce had his head appeared above it however, when
he quickly dodged back, and another lump flew whizzing down the broad
avenue of light.</p>

<p>"Just as I suspected," said he; "they know we are here and the fireman
is pegging coal at us to amuse himself."</p>

<p>"What will we do?"</p>

<p>"Why, we can't do any thing, only wrap our coats over our heads and let
him peg away. They can't bounce us until the train stops."</p>

<p>But the fireman soon tired of his sport, and only an occasional missile
reminded the voyagers that their presence was known in the cab.
Once Ben in changing his position, arose to his feet and looked the
Cyclopean eye square in the pupil. Tom hastily pulled him down; but
none too soon, for a shower of coal announced the indignation he had
excited behind them.</p>

<p>He really enjoyed the ride and could scarce credit his senses when his
companion informed him that they had come forty miles. It was agreed
to leave the pilot the moment the train slackened speed enough to
permit their so doing, and Tommy thought that it would be impolitic to
attempt to "jump" it again, as their presence was known. Therefore,
when the train drew up on entering the depot at Trenton, our voyagers
jumped from their perch and were greeted with a shower of coal and a
volley of imprecations by the irate fireman, both missiles passing them
harmlessly.</p>

<p>As they turned to look at the long line of passenger coaches, now
slowly drawing to a stop in the depot, Ben uttered a cry of surprise.
Seated at an open window he had seen the great, glorious, grey eyes,
and their owner. Beside her sat an elderly gentleman, while in a seat,
immediately in their rear, was his antagonist of the previous evening.
His own surprise prevented him from noticing that Tommy's face had
grown ashy white, and while the boy's teeth were clenched until his
lips grew blue, his eyes glowed with an unnatural fire. Cleveland was
about to move off toward the train, when Tommy caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked, hotly.</p>

<p>"On that train, Tom; I must, I must!" answered he, little appreciating
what he was saying.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool. What are you going to do on that train without money?"</p>

<p>Ben immediately recovered his senses, and looked dejected.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, partner?" asked Tommy as he took him by
the arm and the two turned away. "What ails you?"</p>

<p>"Tom," said Ben solemnly, "it may seem very foolish to you, but I
should like to know that young lady, very much."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I—I don't really know; but I should, indeed I should!" he repeated
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ben, I'll tell you something for your consolation," said the boy;
"they are going to St. Louis, too!"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Ben, in surprise.</p>

<p>"That young woman with the grey eyes."</p>

<p>Ben looked his amazement:</p>

<p>"Tom," he at last said, "who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm myself," replied Tom. "There's no mystery about me, partner. That
party is going to St. Louis, and I happened to overhear them say so in
Jersey City. Perhaps you may meet them there; and," he added in a lower
tone that Ben did not hear, "perhaps <i>I</i> may."</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">THE PULLMAN BOX CAR.</p>


<p>While loafing about the depot, waiting for another Philadelphia train,
a string of empty coal flats and gondolas drew slowly past on another
track. Tom's quick, practical and <i>professional</i> eye immediately
noticed them, and also the brand on the cars telling the road they
belonged to.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said he, "we've made a close connection! Come on!" and
in a short time Ben found himself at the bottom of a black, dusty
coal-smeared gondola.</p>

<p>"Bully!" exclaimed Tommy. "Here we are and no one saw us get in, so if
we keep quiet and lay low we are not likely to be disturbed."</p>

<p>This prediction proved correct, for they travelled the remainder of
the night in the gondola without being noticed. The train went slow,
and stopped often, switching frequently, but as they lay at the bottom
of the car and there was no travelling over them by employees, they
were not interfered with. Singularly enough, Ben fell asleep while the
train was in motion, and slept well. The jolting of the gondola became
rather conducive to his slumbers, than otherwise.</p>

<p>In the grey of the dawn the two got down at a side track, in the city
of Easton, Pennsylvania, covered with coal dust and as black as chimney
sweeps.</p>

<p>"We are across the State of New Jersey, anyway," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"That's encouraging," returned Ben. "If I make as good time right
through, I shall win my wager easily."</p>

<p>"What wager?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>Ben was momentarily confused, but answered that he had wagered with
some friends that he could make St. Louis by the 22d of the month.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy enough done. Let us have a scrub up, and then get some
chuck."</p>

<p>The "scrubbing up" proved a formidable operation. The coal dust seemed
ground into their skins, and despite much rubbing under the spout of a
pump, Ben differed materially in appearance from the young gentleman
who had left New York city but a day before. Much of this was due to
the rumpled and dirty condition of his clothes, which were all creased,
and gave him the appearance of having been run through a mill of some
sort.</p>

<p>The two travellers separated with the agreement to meet at the railway
station in about an hour, and perfect plans for future operations.
Ben was quite hungry. His long night's ride had given him a vigorous
appetite that he felt would have to be appeased shortly. He also felt
that the past forty-eight hours had wrought a great change in him. He
was no longer himself, so to speak. A new man had been born within
him. A callous, careless, independent man, that had not been in his
possession before. He felt indifferent as to appearances, and the
stares of strangers did not annoy him. He shuffled along with his
hands in his pockets, and head down. He <i>slouched</i>. A marked contrast
to his usual erect deportment. In fact, he was becoming (though he
did not know it) a tramp. It still was humiliating to have to ask for
something to eat, but nature overcame his objections, and he proceeded
to the back door of a comfortable cottage. The door was open, and a
rough-looking, dirty man was seated at a table eating his breakfast.</p>

<p>"Well?" said this individual, surveying Ben surlily.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; but—but—I'd like to do something to earn a little
breakfast, if—"</p>

<p>"That's enough!" interrupted the man. "Go work for your living, and
earn it, as I have to do. Be off now, and see that you don't take any
thing that don't belong to you. You tramps should be arrested. The
country's overrun and ruined with you. Why don't you give up your lazy
life and go to honest work like the rest of us?"</p>

<p>Poor Ben hastily left, and felt very bad about his reception. After a
short time his mortification turned to anger, and he wished a score of
times that he could have the dirty man all to himself in a quiet place
for a short time. He moreover determined to get some breakfast if he
had to visit every house in Easton. In fact the repulse, in a manner,
did him good.</p>

<p>His next attempt was successful, and a hospitable housewife, after
shooing her children into the house with her extended dress, gave him
a very substantial repast on the back door step. She was evidently
accustomed to back door guests, and said but little and asked no
questions. They had ceased to be a novelty.</p>

<p>Thanking her in a gentlemanly manner,—something that called a look of
surprise to the lady's kind face—our hero made his way to the depot,
with a feeling of quiet rest in the region of his late hunger that was
highly satisfactory and worth all the humiliation in the world. Who
should he there discover seated on the depot steps, picking his teeth
with a splinter and hugging a small bundle under his arm, but the dirty
man that had refused him a breakfast. He was half inclined to go up and
reproach him for his inhospitality; but thought better of the matter,
and was passing on with a frown, when the dirty man looked up with a
grin, and said:</p>

<p>"Get yer peck, pardy?"</p>

<p>"What?" said Ben, turning angrily upon him.</p>

<p>"Get your commissary filled? There, there. You needn't be angry at me.
There wasn't enough for two—I swar there wasn't. I'd invited you in if
thur hed been."</p>

<p>"Why you confounded puppy, you are nothing but a tramp yourself, then!"
exclaimed Ben in indignant astonishment.</p>

<p>"Incourse," coolly replied the dirty man; "I never 'lowed I wus any
thing else." And he grinned again.</p>

<p>Ben felt that this grin was contagious, and as his outraged sensibility
would not permit him entering into fellowship with his brother
professional, he moved away. Ultimately Tommy and he had a good laugh
over the fellow's cool impudence.</p>

<p>Tommy shortly made his appearance, having met with his usual success,
though he confessed to visiting six different houses before his
appetite was appeased.</p>

<p>A freight train stood on a side track a short distance from the depot,
and after a professional exploration, the boy returned with the
intelligence that it numbered several "empties."</p>

<p>"It is a splendid chance," said he, enthusiastically. "I asked one of
the yardmen and he says the train is made up for over the mountains. We
might make Pittsburg on it."</p>

<p>A few moments later the two were safely ensconced in an empty car,
having crawled through the window in the end, all unobserved. Crouching
down in a corner they remained perfectly quiet, rarely speaking even
in a whisper, lest they should attract attention from the outside.
Several times footsteps were heard passing, and their coming and going
were matters of the most intense anxiety to Ben, whose imagination made
every sound a conductor's approach and an accompanying discovery. At
last the train started; backed up on another track; switched around
some cars; and then all remained quiet again for a few moments, until
the engineer suddenly sounded "off brakes" with his whistle, and the
voyagers were congratulating themselves on a start, when a dark object
was hurled through the window, and following it, three ragged men, one
after another, plunged through, headforemost; much the same as the
clown goes through the baker's window, in the pantomime.</p>

<p>"Helloa! Blazes!" exclaimed the first to alight. "All the berths taken?"</p>

<p>"Hush," said Tom, "or you will give us away."</p>

<p>"That's all right. We're solid now. The train's in motion," said
another; while the third stepped off the "wind up" to a familiar jig,
in testimony to his utter indifference to noise.</p>

<p>Indeed the train being in motion the chances of discovery were greatly
diminished in the voyagers' favor.</p>

<p>"Where you travelling, boss?" asked he of the antique carpet-bag, which
proved to be the dark object that had first entered the window.</p>

<p>"St. Louis," answered Ben.</p>

<p>"St. Louis be blowed. I come from there three months ago. The town's
a good town, but its always crowded. Better go South. Cold weather's
coming on before long,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">"And I sigh for the land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the orange blossoms bloom."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And he wound up by singing these lines in a rich baritone voice.</p>

<p>"Where are you fellows going?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Cincinnati, sure's you breathe," answered one.</p>

<p>"An' then New Orleans an' the jetties! We're the United States Special
Commission for ascertaining the depth of water in the South West
Pass,—that's who we are!" said the terpsichorean artist; and another
series of jig steps emphasized this important announcement.</p>

<p>"Hello, young fellow," exclaimed the third man, extending a nod of
recognition to Tommy. "How de do. Got this fur, hev ye?"</p>

<p>Tommy recognized a fellow traveller who had journeyed from Hartford to
New Haven in a Pullman palace box car with him. He recounted what had
happened to him since they last met, and in return his old companion
told him he had been to Albany, taken a look at the Legislature, saw
the political bummers gathered there and felt ashamed of their company,
departed for Troy to attend a municipal election, got on a glorious
spree, been locked up, had the freedom of the outskirts of the city
granted him at the police court, "beat" his way to New York on a North
River boat, and was now migrating South to save the expenses of an
overcoat.</p>

<p>From the conversation that followed, Ben learned that one was a
printer, another a carpenter, and the terpsichorean artist an iron and
brass moulder by trade and a variety performer by profession. They
had several times obtained work during the summer, but the love of a
vagabond life was so strong within them, that job after job had been
deserted for this roving. He also obtained a glimpse of a fact that
became more palpable, the more he associated during his tramp, with
this class of American gypsies. It was, that underlying the rambling
propensities,—nay the very instigator of those propensities—was the
vice of drunkenness. In their quieter moments expressions escaped
the trio that demonstrated a hearty contempt for the life they were
leading, and a haunting desire to return to the paths of honest
industry, and the comforts of a settled home. But however strong this
last feeling may have been, it was evidently overruled by the thirst
after those hell-born stimulants with which man is allowed to destroy
the peace and prosperity of his fellow man. As the printer remarked to
Ben:</p>

<p>"I tell you, boss, there's not a ragged coat on a dirty back, or a pair
of torn shoes on the bruised and blistered feet of the thousands of
tramps that are rambling around the country like wild men, but whiskey
is the first cause of it!"</p>

<p>"Then why don't they stop using it?" asked Cleveland.</p>

<p>"Give it up!" he exclaimed. "As well ask them to give up life. So
long as the cursed stuff is made, so long will men drink it, and the
government that licenses and protects it are responsible for the
vagabonds it makes. They're holding conventions, and wanting to know
what the devil they're to do with the tramps? Shut up the distilleries
and in two years there will be no tramps! Many men can not give up
the use of liquor when left to themselves. It is not a habit, it is a
cur—."</p>

<p>"Oh cheese your preaching! Here—this killed me father and I'll have
revenge on it!" and with a savage laugh the moulder thrust a bottle
into the printer's hand.</p>

<p>The printer, who was a man of middle age, looked at the liquor askance
a moment, and addressed it as follows:</p>

<p>"Oh, you father of all curses! Murderer, thief, ravisher! Stealer of
men's brains! Caterer for the gallows! Feeder of the jails! Soaked
in the tears of widows, mothers and orphans! Iconoclast, breaking
the images of all we love! Defying God, and defacing his handiwork!
Daubing blood on the face of humanity! Smearing crime on the garments
of society! Barring the door to Heaven! Paving the way to Hell! Curse
you! Curse you! Curse those that make you! Curse those in power that
allow you to exist! Fragments of Hell hurled into Nineteenth Century!
How I hate you!—<i>How I love you!</i>" and with trembling hand, and
glittering eye, he drank deep of the bottle's contents.</p>

<p>The liquor was then passed around, but when it came to Ben he refused
it. In that box car and from those homeless vagabonds he had learned
a lesson that he promised himself should last him a lifetime. It was
"Total abstinence." <i>Absolutely total</i>:—the only safeguard against the
<i>disease</i> of drunkenness.</p>

<p>Singular enough his rough companions did not take his refusal to drink
with them amiss. The moulder said: "It's the best thing you ever did in
your life to let it alone," which the carpenter indorsed, by remarking:
"If I'd done it years ago, I'd not be here now."</p>

<p>But the printer said—rather irrelevantly, and quite profanely:</p>

<p>"We're all going to Hell anyway! What's the odds so long's you're
happy!"</p>

<p>After awhile the three tramps sat down in a corner of the car, and one
of them producing a ragged pack of cards, (which same, he stated, with
pardonable pride, had been in every state of the Union, and on nearly
all the railroads) they were soon engaged in the mysteries of that
ancient game, "cut-throat old-sledge," the stakes being a pull at the
bottle.</p>

<p>Ben felt drowsy, and having had but little sleep the previous night,
stretched himself at full length on the car floor and was soon lost in
a sound slumber. The travellers having securely fastened the end gate
shut with a nail (to prevent other tramps from imposing their presence
among them, and also to repel the curiosity of train employees,) kept
remarkably quiet whenever the train stopped, which it frequently did,
and so rode along in safety.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">A BLOCK IN THE WAY.</p>


<p>Ben was awakened from a sound sleep of many hours, by a rough thrust in
the side.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Hough?" he exclaimed, his scattered thoughts not
having yet all returned from dreamland.</p>

<p>"I'll 'how' you, you scoundrel! Get out of this!" and another vigorous
poke in the ribs with a barrel stave followed.</p>

<p>This last attack thoroughly aroused our friend, who awoke to find the
car deserted by all save himself, while at the end gate appeared the
face of a burly brakeman who was thus unceremoniously stirring him up
with a stave.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Matter? The matter is that you'll get out of this pretty lively, or
I'll come in there and throw you out!" cried he of the stave.</p>

<p>"Come in and try it," laconically replied our traveller.</p>

<p>The conductor, who was standing outside, watching his deputy's
performance, asked the latter if any thing was the matter and if he
needed help.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the brakeman was what is known, in the language
of the road, as a "bouncer." That is, he was a hybrid combining the
qualities of a brakeman and a bruiser, and was frequently called
into requisition by the conductor to take the dirty work of ejecting
tramps off of his hands. So he replied to his chief that he needed
no assistance, but would send him down a tramp in piecemeal in a few
moments. With this he plunged through the end gate, intent on giving
Ben a sound drubbing. But he reckoned without his host. Ben was a
stout, sinewy, young fellow, and an excellent boxer, though his muscles
lacked hardness. As the "bouncer" reached for his collar with one
hand, while with the other he aimed a blow at his face, Ben gave him
a trip accompanied by a stinging punch between the eyes that sent him
sprawling to the floor; and with a knowledge of the work before him,
brought his adversary down with smart raps three times successively, as
the bully strove to regain his feet.</p>

<p>At this unexpected treatment the professional "bouncer" called loudly
for help, and his chief, sliding back a side door, sprang to the
rescue, also armed with a stave. When Ben, whose blood was now up,
turned to face his new assailant, the "bouncer" regained his feet and
stave, and aiming a vicious blow at Ben missed him, from the fact that
the latter at that moment, by accident, stepped aside, and the stave
brought the conductor a tremendous thwack on the side of his head.
This so startled and enraged the latter, that howling with pain and
maddened with the blood starting from a gashed cheek, he ignored Ben,
and returned the "bouncer" his blow with interest, and in a moment the
two were engaged in a give and take pitch battle.</p>

<p>Our hero was on the point of vacating the car, but noticing that the
conductor, who was a small man, was about to get the worst of it, he
turned, and seizing the "bouncer" by the collar hurled him through the
open door, and followed himself, intent on renewing the battle outside,
when he suddenly found himself surrounded by the majesty of the law in
the shape of a policeman. Two other guardians of the peace attracted
to the scene by the noise of the encounter, seized the conductor and
brakeman, and the trio were marched off, followed by half a score of
rail-roaders; the two damaged officials breathing fire and fury upon
one another to the utter neglect of Ben. The officer in charge of our
friend informed him that he was safely landed in the ancient town of
Harrisburg, and that it was five o'clock.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as it ultimately proved, the police court was still
in session, being engaged on special business. The prisoners were
therefore immediately marched into the presence of a short, plethoric
Milesian gentleman, who upheld the honors of the municipal bench.</p>

<p>No sooner did his eyes encounter the form of our friend than he called
out:</p>

<p>"What! Here again, are yez! What did I tell yez the last time! Ye're
here too often, that yez air. Do yez think the coort was made for
your consumption? It's twinty dollars and costs, or sixty days in the
lockup. Shut up! Every word out of yez will be sixty days more. What's
the charges, officer?"</p>

<p>Poor Ben was dumbfounded. He was positive he had never met this vicious
little magnate before in all his life, and did not know that the
greeting he received was the august manner in which the blind goddess
of the police court of Harrisburg struck terror into the hearts of
those who had the misfortune to tread on the tail of her coat.</p>

<p>The preference of a hearing was given to the conductor and brakeman.
Both had now secured legal assistance, and a charge of assault and
battery was preferred by each against the other. Their cases were set
for a future hearing, and both released on their own recognizance;
when they immediately withdrew accompanied by their friends, entirely
neglecting Ben, much to his gratification. All the officer who had
arrested him could charge him with was being a vagrant caught in the
vicinity of railroad property; which same is a serious enough petty
offence along the line of the Central road.</p>

<p>The little judge asked him if he had any thing to say for himself,
and immediately thereafter told him to "shut up!" He then went into a
lengthy diatribe against tramps in general, and wound up by giving Ben
sixty days in the workhouse.</p>

<p>Our traveller stood aghast! There was no provision in his wager about
forcible detention, and he felt himself lost. Here then was an end to
all his hopes and ambitions. From a tramp he was about to descend to
the deeper degradation of a workhouse experience. The little justice
must have noticed his consternation, for he smiled gleefully.</p>

<p>"Oye, that shuits yez <i>too well</i>, don't it?" he exclaimed. "Sixty days
boord, lodgin' and washin' at the ixpinse av the county! Egad sor,
it ud be foin! Chur foin, me lad, chur foin! Yez hid bate yer way an
hundrid moils for the loike; so yez would! We'd have all the thramps
in the country to kape, so we would, be gorra! Pater, is the walkin'
good?" this last to a policeman.</p>

<p>"Yes, your Honor," answered Peter.</p>

<p>"Thin furnish this gintleman wid a good map av the county, and the
coort will suspind sintince for <i>wan hour</i>! Nixt!"</p>

<p>An officer accompanied our friend to the door of the hall of justice,
and bade him leave the city immediately; and the little judge shouted
after him:</p>

<p>"Moind yez thramp, if yez air found in the city of Horrisbug sixty
minutes from the prisint momint, Oil set yez chu studyin' geology wid
a hammer for the binefit of the city strates for the remainder av the
year. Now moind!"</p>

<p>Ben was so overjoyed with his freedom that the terrible words of this
terrible little man were music in his ears. His first thought on
regaining the street was to get out of town. His next one was to get
on the railroad track and strike westward. He wondered what could have
become of Tommy, and sadly missed his little companion.</p>

<p>To retrace our steps and account for his having been left alone in
the car will not necessitate much of a digression. While Ben placidly
slept the three tramps continued their game of "old-sledge" and their
application to the bottle. They at last became so primed with the evil
spirits in the latter, as to awake belligerent spirits of their own,
and as the train drew into Harrisburg were engaged in a loud wrangle
that was heard by employees in the yard, and they were consequently
routed out of the car, and Tommy along with them. Ben, however, was
overlooked, and his little friend viewing it as a stroke of good
fortune in the sleeper's favor, thought to allow him to remain and ride
through so far as he could alone. But the train had received orders to
sidetrack in Harrisburg and await instructions, and while on the side
track, Ben's snoring had attracted the attention of the conductor with
the results already known to the reader.</p>

<p>Taking to the track as his surest and safest road, the sun was kissing
earth good-night, when he left the city limits of Harrisburg behind
him. He walked on at a brisk pace until twilight gathered its dusky
arms about him and then found it necessary to go a little slower, as he
was continually stumbling against the ties.</p>

<p>About three miles from the city he was met by two voyagers going east.
These gentlemen of the foot-path informed him that they were on their
way to Philadelphia, and had been "bounced" from a freight train
some six miles back. Neither appeared to have any definite object
in visiting Philadelphia, and were probably travelling on general
principles, thinking they might as well be going there as any where.
Their intention was to make Harrisburg and lodge in the police station;
resuming their line of march in the morning.</p>

<p>These tramps were quite kind in supplying Cleveland with information
relative to his route. They stated that the road was crowded with
tramps, going in both directions, but the majority heading for the
west. They also told him of several good "hang ups," in the way of
barns and sheds, that with the eyes of experts they had noticed as they
came along.</p>

<p>Ben lost no time in seeking a comfortable resting place and was soon
asleep dreaming of two great, glorious, grey eyes that looked out
sweetly upon him from the snowy folds of a nubia. Then, as he dreamed,
the look in the grey eyes changed to one of sorrow, and they filled
with tears. Anon a look of fright filled them, and the voice of the
fair one called to him: "Save me Ben! Save me!"</p>

<p>And Ben crying out "I will!" sprang to his feet, and found, by Tommy's
time piece—the Dipper—that he had slept nearly five hours.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">A GLIMPSE OF DEATH.</p>


<p>Cleveland hastened down the track in the bright star light, and arrived
at the tank referred to by the two tramps, just in time. For scarce
had he retreated into a clump of weeds, when the freight train made
its appearance and stopped for water. Ben had now some experience in
boarding trains, and in a quiet, stealthy manner crept along the sides
of the cars, with a watchful eye and ear for train men. At last he
found one with an end window open. It proved to be a box car loaded
with lumber, with just the nicest little place in the world for a man
to stow himself away in. The lumber was piled up to within a few inches
of the roof, but between the ends of the planks and the end of the
car was a space about three feet wide, in which he hastened to lower
himself with a congratulatory chuckle.</p>

<p>By feeling the boards he discovered that the load consisted of inch
planks, of dressed lumber, for some three feet from the car floor,
after which followed two inch planking. The ends of the top load of
two inch stuff projected a foot or more, like a verandah roof, over
the inch boards, and made him quite as cosy and comfortable a little
house as the heart of a tramp could desire. What is more it was warm
and clean, and our traveller stretching himself on the floor of his
apartment, was soon sound asleep, with the song of the wheels and the
response of the ringing rails in his ears for a lullaby.</p>

<p>Long he slept, and well; until wicked dreams came to abuse his
curtained sleep. First they intruded upon him in the shape of great,
glorious, grey eyes and a nubia, and several moments of ecstasy were
passed in the company thereof. Indeed many men can make love better
asleep than they can awake, and who of the sterner sex, when young
and lusty in the full vigor of brand new manhood, has not had those
luscious dreams, a counterpart of which it would be impossible for
reality to produce! If there be him who has not had them—he has our
sympathy. Nature has withheld from him one of the choicest bon-bons in
her basket.</p>

<p>So Ben dreamed. He was with <i>her</i>. Her hand was in his, her heart
beating against his heart, her warm breath on his cheek, her glowing
breast heaving in gentle undulations against his bosom. She murmured
love, confidence and endearments. He talked heroically, and felt the
cup of his happiness full to running over. But there came a change.
Suddenly a tall dark man came between them, and attempted to separate
the lovers. She clung about his neck and prayed him to save her. But
the dark man overpowered him. He tore her from his arms and wound
his own with an iron grip about Ben's form. He struggled to release
himself. His struggles were futile. Closer and closer grew the embrace.
It seemed as though it was crushing in his bones. He could not breathe
with it. It had assumed the coils of a gigantic serpent, and fold upon
fold was wrapped around his body and tightening upon it. He writhed
and groaned in agony. His breath came short and thick. His head seemed
a molten mass of fire, bursting with the pressure. His eyes started
from their sockets. Yet closer, still closer, the folds drew about him,
and the dark face of the man became the hideous, gaping mouth of a
serpent, that licked him with its forked tongue, and whose hiss sounded
deafening in his ears, while its bright, devilish little eyes gloated
on him with terrible intent.</p>

<p>With a yell of fear and agony he awoke!</p>

<p>His clothes were wringing with sweat, and the perspiration was pouring
from his body. All was dark,—Egyptian darkness,—a fearful, appalling
black!</p>

<p>And though awake, the iron folds still held him in their terrible
embrace. Was he awake! Was it real! Was it not some horrible nightmare
that still accompanied him!</p>

<p>What was this iron hand that clutched him? What these terrible coils
about his person, squeezing life out of him? What this hot, close
burning breath he felt?</p>

<p>Arouse you Ben, arouse and pray! Pray! Pray as you never prayed in your
life before! The gates of Eternity are swinging ajar, and you are to
have a glimpse of DEATH.</p>

<p>One hand, partly released, he extended upward. Horror! It struck
against a solid wall of lumber that completely closed him in, and
converted his chamber into a living tomb. But <i>there</i> was not death.
No, no. That was but the <i>trap</i>. Death came surging down upon him in
the shape of four thousand feet of lumber, moving slowly, noiselessly,
but oh, how fearful and sure, upon his devoted body, as the train
toiled up a heavy grade. Already the mass had pinned him to the end
of the car so that he could not move his body. It was crushing in his
very ribs. He found it hard to breathe. His head was on fire. He yelled
and shrieked for help. Prayed; entreated; supplicated. All in vain.
The revolving wheels crunched out a dismal monody beneath him. Requiem
for a dying soul. And afar off could be heard the groaning of the
locomotive as it toiled up the steep mountain side.</p>

<p>Horrible fancies took possession of him. He thought himself dead and
laughed deliriously. Then, in saner moments, he called upon his God
to end his torture, and send a speedy death to his release. A release
from the slow, lethargic, creeping monster, that was sucking up his
life atom by atom; hair's breadth by hair's breadth. In those few
awful moments the panorama of his life was unfolded, and the dead past
resurrected, revealing itself more palpable to him than the living
present. Worse than the tortures of the Inquisition, where weights were
heaped upon the breast of a prostrate man, were now upon him. Shorter
and shorter came his breath. He hated to die! He would not! He could
not! Ha, ha! The great, dull, shapeless fiend that was crushing out
his existence seemed to laugh at him derisively. Blood started from
his nostrils; water gushed from his eyes; and the fiend with one great
yell closed a last clutch upon his life, and he was released from his
agony.</p>

<p>When Ben recovered consciousness he was lying on the floor of the car,
and a kind, rough face was bending over him. There was plenty of room
about him. The last yell of the fiend that was smothering him, when he
lost consciousness, was the whistle of the locomotive announcing that
it had reached the summit of the grade. In the descent on the other
side, the lumber had moved away from him as steadily as it had before
moved down upon him. Had the up grade lasted but a short distance
further, his tramp would have been over forever. There was blood upon
his face as a reminder of the agony he had passed through, and he felt
weak, limp and lifeless, while the clear sun light was streaming in
upon him from the open end gate.</p>

<p>"That was a pretty close call, my friend," said the brakeman, who in
going over the cars had chanced to look in at the open window and
noticed our friend stretched lifeless upon the floor. Though it was
nearly an hour after he had received his squeeze, the man readily
understood the situation and the peril Ben had passed through. "That
was a pretty close call on you."</p>

<p>"It was that," faintly responded Ben.</p>

<p>"I remember you," continued the man; "you are the tramp that whipped
Joe Brown at Harrisburg yesterday. I don't approve of fighting, but I'm
glad you gave <i>him</i> a beating. He's the biggest bully on the road, and
takes a delight in thumping men smaller than himself. Where are you
bound for? St. Louis, hey. And you aint got no money? No? Well there
are a great many travelling in your fix, nowadays, and our orders are
very strict about putting them off the trains. But I'll break rules
this time, and won't know that you're here."</p>

<p>Ben looked his gratitude, and pressed the man's hand.</p>

<p>"You can stay safely here now," he continued; "for the road's pretty
level for some miles yet. When we are to go up the mountains, I'll come
back here, and show you another car that's filled with barrels, and you
can get in at the end window and go safe to Alatoona."</p>

<p>"God bless you!" said Ben fervently. "I feel very weak."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see you do," and a look of sympathy came over the great, rough,
grimy face of the brakeman, and looked well there, although the face
was badly mottled with coal dust and tobacco-juice. "I see you do,
partner. And it's agin rules bad, and they <i>are</i> strict, but when this
crew changes at Alatoona, I'll give you a good word with the man that
takes my place, and you may be able to make it to Pittsburg. There'll
be down brakes in a minute, for a crossing, and I must go. So long."
And his burly figure crawled through the window, and out on the roof of
the car.</p>

<p>Ben had closed his eyes a moment, when they again opened to see the
face of the brakeman, upside down at the end gate, he being extended
flat on the roof of the car.</p>

<p>"I say, partner, that was pretty close, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Ben nodded.</p>

<p>"Was yer <i>prepared</i>, partner?"</p>

<p>Ben looked his surprise.</p>

<p>"Did you know who shoved that there lumber back off of ye?"</p>

<p>Our friend shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"God did it, partner. You might say a word of thanks, if yer felt
so inclined. So long." And the dirt-begrimed, tobacco-painted face
disappeared.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">THE MARCH TO FORT DUQUESNE.</p>


<p>The train man was as good as his word. Ere they climbed the mountains
to the pretty town of Alatoona, that sits perched like a crow's nest,
on the summit of the Alleghanies, he transferred Ben to another car.
And when they reached Alatoona, and the train changed crews, he not
only gave him into the care of another brakeman of the new crew, but,
as the train would stop there half an hour, he took him to his own home
and made him eat a substantial meal.</p>

<p>Daylight was fading out of the west when the train drew out of
Alatoona. The car with the barrels in had been left, and our hero was
now safely stowed in one loaded with pig iron that had been brought
off of the Williamsburg branch. Darkness prevented the traveller
from viewing the glorious mountain scenery, in the train's descent
from the hills. The great Horse Shoe Bend, with its panoramic views
of mountains, woodlands, and valleys; the old grade on the opposite
mountains, where—in times of yore—they sailed canal boats over the
hills on rails, and deposited them safely in their native elements on
the western slope, together with the many enchanting scenes this road
runs through, were all lost to him. Nor did he see Johnstown, with its
great Cambria Iron and Steel Works, the largest in the world (and a
popular resort of hundreds of tramps who journey that way and toast
their sides among its many fires and furnaces). Nor could he view the
noisy little Conemaugh, that led the rail road along its bank to the
foot hills below. We say Ben saw none of these, for, in the first place
it was night, and in the second, his patron—the new brakeman—had
shut him up in the car, and told him to keep the doors and end gates
closed, both as a matter of protection from the prying eyes of road
officials, and to prevent a horde of impecunious travellers—like
Ben—from entering. The last was by no means visionary advice, for at
nearly every station and side track the doors and windows were tried by
tramps, who had awaited the shades of night to aid them in "jumping" a
train.</p>

<p>Ben, still somewhat weak from his recent adventure, yet feeling in
a peaceful state of mind from the assurance of his ride and the
beneficial effect of the hearty supper he had made at the home of the
hospitable brakeman in Alatoona, dozed on the pig iron. His bed was
a hard one, to be sure; but when one side was dented so as to be no
longer endured (which occurred every little while) he turned over on
another; and by so revolving discovered the important fact that a man
is in possession of four sides with which he may lie on the hardest of
beds in comparative comfort by judiciously using them in rotation.
That is continually turning from left to right or right to left, as the
case may be, so that when No. 1 is worn out No. 4 will be fresh, and
ready for use.</p>

<p>When they arrived in the outskirts of the city of Pittsburg, the
brakeman appeared at the end gate and told Ben he had best disembark at
East Liberty and walk into the city, to avoid being seen by watchmen at
the lower yards. Cleveland thanked him for the ride, and, as the train
slacked up, dismounted to find himself in the suburbs of the Smoky
City, in the grey of the dawn.</p>

<p>"Good enough," said he, stretching himself, and rubbing his stiffened
limbs; "good enough. Three days gone and I have made over four hundred
and fifty miles. If I can keep up this rate of travel I will win my
wager and have time to spare."</p>

<p>As he walked toward the heart of the city, he met several knights
of the foot-path who had rolled out of lumber yards and from about
the furnaces of iron mills. These informed him that Pittsburg was
considered an excellent tramp town by the fraternity. Indeed the
generous citizens had established a home for them on Duquesne Way,
where they were both lodged and fed in gorgeous style. But, he was
told, breakfast would be over before he could reach the "home," and as
the tramps did not dine until six P.M., and guests were not allowed to
remain in the <i>salon</i> during the day time, our traveller reflected that
it would do him no good to visit the institution until hospitalities
opened. As he still felt too weak for the road, he resolved to spend
the day in fasting and viewing the iron industries for which the city
is famous. He strolled around among these and chatting with the hands
was told that the good town's glory was departing from out its hands.
Years ago, before it became a great iron mart, the city had been the
most extensive shipping point in the <i>then</i> "Great West." Steamboats
crowded one another at its levees, and the manufacturers of the east
were continually departing down the Ohio, for the southern and western
countries, in vast quantities. Then came the era of rail roads and
the rapid settlement of the far west, and Fort Duquesne, as a great
shipping point, ceased to exist. But when this industry was wrested
from it, the brave old town adopted another. The transportation center
of vast coal fields and iron deposits, she soon became a manufacturing
hive, unequalled on the continent, and for many years upheld the
reputation of the Birmingham of America.</p>

<p>But there came a change.</p>

<p>Capital ripped open the bowels of Mother Earth, and stole the ores
with which the good dame was pregnant, in other and newer localities,
far away. Iron works shot up their tall chimnies all over the west; at
Cleveland, Columbus, Chicago, Joliet, Indianapolis, Terra Haute, St.
Louis and elsewhere. As a consequence the good town found its second
sceptre taken away, and the grip it had held upon the Great West, so
long and well, Ben found had dwindled down to its coal fleets, which,
with the vast natural resources of Pittsburg's water-ways, it is never
likely to be deprived of. All this he heard, and much more. He learned
that the city had a magnificent debt—that was a thing of beauty and
apparently a joy forever. No one appeared to know just how much it
was, but all agreed that it was ahead, per capita, of any other city
in the Union—and this was a source of much honest pride. For though
the city's commerce and manufactures might be stolen from it by western
upstarts, they could not take its debt.</p>

<p>Ben discovered more real courtesy and kindness toward poverty in
Pittsburg, than in any other town he visited during his tramp. The
inhabitants were sociable, generous and unpretending.</p>

<p>While our friend was standing in the doorway of a mill, observing the
men draw out the glowing, cherry-red bars from the rolls, and listening
to the "bloom" snap and crackle, like a roll of musketry, in the jaws
of the squeezer, he heard a little exclamation in a female voice. It
was simply "Oh, my!" but it sent a thrill through every nerve in his
body, for it was the voice of her he nightly met in his dreams. He
dared not look up, but stood there, <i>feeling</i> her presence, and with
the music of her voice ringing in his ears, waiting to hear her speak
again.</p>

<p>But the "Oh, my!" was not repeated, as she of the grey, glorious eyes
had only made the exclamation while passing in company with an elderly
gentleman, and observing the glowing "bloom" pass into the squeezer.
When Ben looked up, they were no where to be seen.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "what is to be, will be. Tommy said they were
going to St. Louis, and I may see her there. In my present condition
it would do me but little good to meet her, anyway, I presume. I'm a
tramp! Actually and professionally, a <i>tramp</i>, and I begin to look
and feel like one. Should I lose my wager, I may adopt the business
permanently," and he laughed not altogether well pleased with himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">A MYSTERY.</p>


<p>"I tell you, Nipper, if you will only give me half a chance I will make
the matter all right. What do you get by pushing me so? The plain facts
are that if you have me arrested, you get <i>nothing</i>; whereas if you let
me alone I will do as I have promised, and you shall not only have the
full value of the notes, but the bonus besides."</p>

<p>Ben listened intently for the answer. It was in the dusk of evening,
and he was sauntering up from a view of one of the most picturesque
bridges in the world—and the only one of its kind in the United
States; there being only one duplicate in existence, and that in
Europe. It is of iron and spans the Monongahela (Oh gloriously
suggestive name! Whose delightfully realistic anatomy is so pregnant
with remembrances of the liquid destruction our grandsires admired!)
immediately at the point of land formed by the wedding of that stream
with the Alleghany; the two thereafter journeying through life as one
under the name of Ohio.</p>

<p>As Ben was turning the angle of a low wooden shed, the voices of
persons in conversation struck upon his ear, and the familiar tones of
one of them caused him to take to the shade of the building and play
the not very honorable part of eavesdropper. Charles Lever, in that
picturesque, but highly improbable "Boy of Norcotes," allows the boy
to state in a priggish manner, that eavesdropping is reprehensible on
account of the impossibility of a gentleman using the information so
obtained, and immediately thereafter causes the boy to tell all he
overhears. Ben had not read the book referred to, and did not feel
ashamed of himself. Nor having listened was there a dull, dead feeling
of lost self-respect that urged him to go and throw himself into the
river, and seek at its bottom oblivion offering a rest from remorse
that this life could never offer. Nothing of the sort. He listened
because he wanted to hear, and was glad of the opportunity. For the
voice belonged to the man whom he had had the encounter with in Jersey
City, when he first felt the influence of the grey eyes.</p>

<p>It was the tall dark escort, whom she had called "Arthur," and
he was talking to a thick-necked, thick-shouldered, thick-faced,
and—possibly—thick-headed individual, who appeared—if Ben could
judge from what passed,—to hold Arthur in no very high repute.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Blackoat," said the thick man, "I am in need of the
money, and the matter's run long enough. You have been promising,
and promising, and promising, until I am tired of promises and want
something more substantial, or you "go up" so sure as my name is
Jonah!" And the namesake of the ancient mariner who "beat" the whale
out of forty days board and lodgings, brought one hand down on the
other decisively.</p>

<p>"See here, Nipper," said Blackoat, "don't make a fool of yourself. It
might afford you a high moral satisfaction to know that I was working
for the state, but it would be no money in your pocket. Wait. Be
patient. I can not compel her to marry me, and in another month, if she
continues to refuse me, I will have the money any way—and the whole of
it."</p>

<p>"Three hundred thousand dollars?" asked Jonah.</p>

<p>"Three hundred thousand dollars," replied Blackoat. "I do not ask you
to believe <i>me</i>; go ask old Braster if such is not the will."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that's all right enough, but you are not keeping up to our
agreement, Blackoat," replied Jonah. "You told me you'd marry and
settle with me before August, and here it is September. It won't do.
I'm getting no interest on my money," and this modern Jonah, whom Mr.
Blackoat would have been so pleased to throw overboard and have a whale
swallow, even if it did set wise theologians by the ears for the next
three thousand years, stamped his foot.</p>

<p>"How much interest do you want?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"One thousand dollars a month, until paid, is little enough," answered
Nipper.</p>

<p>"Oh, now the cat's out of the bag. That's what brought you on here, is
it?" cried Blackoat. "I will not give it! I will not!"</p>

<p>"That settles it," replied Nipper quietly, and turning on his heel
professed to be about to walk away, when the other grasped his arm.</p>

<p>"See here, Nipper," said he, in a tone of supplication, "be reasonable."</p>

<p>Nipper turned in a positive manner, and replied in a positive manner
that admitted no protests:</p>

<p>"Blackoat it's <i>forgery</i>! You pay me one thousand dollars a month for
the privilege of remaining out of states prison. You will either agree
to that, and give me notes for it this very night, or I will sacrifice
twenty thousand dollars to see you get your just deserts. You know me."</p>

<p>Alas, Mr. Arthur Blackoat <i>did</i> know him, and knew him only too well.
He knew that this namesake of the original whaler could sacrifice
twenty thousand dollars and still have many thousand left. He also knew
that he would do it if so inclined. Therefore he remarked in a dejected
voice:</p>

<p>"Nipper, it's the meanest piece of work I ever heard of. You knew
of the stipulations of that will, and bought up those notes on
speculation, and the face value would well repay the investment. It's
the—"</p>

<p>"See here, no more of this, Blackoat," sternly interrupted the holder
of the notes. "How I came by the paper is my business. That I <i>do</i>
hold them, and in them have the power to send you to prison and ruin
your chances to get one cent of the three hundred thousand dollars, is
enough for you to know. Will you do as I demand? Answer yes or no?"</p>

<p>"It's an outrage, but I'll have to submit," replied Blackoat, angrily.
"Come to the Monongahela House and I will give you my notes for it,"
and Mr. Blackoat turned toward his hotel, with Mr. Nipper quietly
walking beside him.</p>

<p>Ben was about to leave the friendly shade that had hidden him, when a
small, lithe figure sprang from the shed through an aperture made by a
loosened board. This new party on the scene gazed earnestly after the
two retreating men; shook his clenched hand at them and muttered, "I'll
have you yet! I'll have you yet!" Then turned and ran swiftly away in
an opposite direction. Ben was so astonished that before he could call
out, the flying form was lost in the dusk of the night.</p>

<p>It was Tommy.</p>

<p>As he slowly wended his steps down Duquesne Way to the great tramp
resort he cogitated upon the evening's developments. And the result of
his reflections was that there was a mystery connecting the owner of
the glorious, grey eyes with Arthur Blackoat, who in turn was likewise
connected with the thick man, Nipper, (who was evidently the latter's
Jonah) and Blackoat in his turn was somehow connected with his little
friend Tommy. But this was as far as he got. What the mystery was he
could not surmise, and as he was not a very imaginative young fellow,
he contented himself with the reflection that "Time tells all things,"
and hoped Time would not neglect its business in this instance.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ben, as he looked up at a somewhat pretentious three story
brick building, fronting on the Alleghany river, "they have provided a
pretty respectable-looking hotel for us people of the foot-path, any
way."</p>

<p>A short flight of stone steps led up to a broad hall way, that entered
a spacious, well-lighted office. Well dressed men were lounging about,
and passing in and out, the same as at any other hotel.</p>

<p>"Indeed," thought our hero, "this <i>is</i> a new departure in tramping.
How well they dress and how comfortable they appear to be." To make no
mistake he stepped up to a group of three men lounging over an iron
railing. Their tatterdemalion attire, and general air of conglomerate
dirt and rags, denoted them to be the bona fide article.</p>

<p>"Recent arrivals, probably, who have not yet had time to recuperate
under the beneficent influences of the 'home,'" thought he.</p>

<p>"Is this the Young Men's Home, the place where they take in strangers?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Yes. There was where they took in strangers. He had struck the right
spot. He was to go right in and register at the office.</p>

<p>Ben entered without noticing that the three tatterdemalions ranged
themselves on the sidewalk where they could get a good view of the
interior, each having a face illumined by a broad grin of expectancy.</p>

<p>The office was a spacious, steam heated apartment. Ben boldly affixed
the name of "B. Cleveland, New York City," to the register, and the
polite clerk asked him if he had had supper. Replying in the negative,
he was informed that supper was still in progress, and pointed out the
dining hall. But as he turned his steps toward the designated door, the
polite clerk called to him:</p>

<p>"One moment, if you please, sir. Have you any baggage?"</p>

<p>"No sir," replied Ben in surprise.</p>

<p>"It is our invariable rule to ask a settlement in advance from those
who have no baggage," said the polite clerk.</p>

<p>"Settlement!" exclaimed Ben growing red to the roots of his hair; "why
I thought this was a charity!"</p>

<p>"Oh," replied the clerk, "you are in the wrong pew. Step around in the
alley, and enter the first door to the right."</p>

<p>As Ben retreated his feelings were not improved by an audible titter
indulged in by the loungers present.</p>

<p>(And right here permit us to parenthetically ask what it is that causes
man to so enjoy the misery of his fellow man? Some one has discovered
that the pinnacle of human happiness is based upon the miseries of
others. Is it so? A drunken man reels, falls and breaks his nose. We
laugh. A poor, poverty-stricken, hungry, ragged wretch is driven from a
door. We laugh. A fellow mortal makes a mistake that causes him intense
mortification and suffering. We laugh. What causes us to do all this
laughing at the troubles of others?)</p>

<p>On the sidewalk Ben was met by the three bona fides, rubbing their
hands in high glee.</p>

<p>"What did he tell you? What did he say? Did you gin him a racket?
He won't take it, he won't. Ha, ha!" and the three were very merry,
it afterwards appearing that the sending of fresh tramps into the
hotel office to annoy the clerk, was an æsthetic diversion peculiarly
acceptable to the trio.</p>

<p>The "entrance in the alley" proved to be quite a different affair. In
a narrow, little landing,—highly perfumed with the odors of rum,
tobacco, and dirt in general,—Ben's age, name, nativity, trade and
condition of life were taken down in a big book by a man who occupied
a small rough board office, and held communications with the outer
world through a diminutive pigeon hole. Having furnished the desired
information, our hero was presented with a meal ticket, and informed
that the hospitalities of the "Home" were extended to him for three
days, if he could not sooner find employment, after which he would have
to provide for himself and pay the transient rates of five cents per
meal and ten cents for lodging.</p>

<p>These preliminaries having been gone through with, he ascended a flight
of narrow stairs, and was ushered into the greatest tramp resort in the
United States, and probably the best patronized in the world.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">THE GREAT TRAMP RENDEZVOUS.</p>


<p>A large bare room, steam heated and furnished with several long tables
and benches, was already filled by nearly three hundred tramps. They
formed a motley crowd. Old and young, of numerous nationalities and
every degree of raggedness and trampdom were there. Young novices,
just entering upon this degraded life. Occasionals—working men
to-day, tramps to-morrow, and drunkards at all times. Professionals,
who preferred mendicancy to honest labor. Honest men, reduced by dire
misfortunes to this sore distress. Sick men, whose hold upon life was
waxing faint. Scorbutic men, bearing on their face and persons the
indelible marks that outraged nature had branded them with, for life.
Sad men, who felt the degradation of their position. Bold, callous men,
for whom this world held no shame; and men whose deportment denoted
that they had seen better days, and could not forget them, were all
gathered there in a heterogenous mass of rags, hunger, dirt, and
profanity.</p>

<p>No notice was taken of Ben's advent among them. Indeed he was
immediately swallowed up in the crowd, the members of which were
variously engaged. Some paced up and down the floor, in lonely
communion with their own thoughts. Some were seated by the wall
patching their garments, and sewing up rents; some reading, others
tossing coppers, and others asleep in all the hubbub and Babel of
voices. Gathered in groups were men discussing the events of the day,
or mapping out routes for future travel. What struck Ben as singular
was the fact that there were very few old men present. Nearly all were
young or in the vigor of manhood. He did not see but one or two old
"war-horses" and they moodily held themselves aloof from the crowd.
There was a hot, fetid air in the room, and his stomach sickened at
this expression of the life he had adopted.</p>

<p>A word of explanation relative to this great tramp "home" will not
be amiss. It was built by the contributions of generous citizens of
Pittsburg as an asylum for the homeless wanderer. A place where he
might rest and recuperate, while he sought employment. One would
naturally suppose that those partaking of the charity would be
grateful, but the tramps are not. A man with authority is continually
employed in preserving the peace among them, and a more ungrateful,
querulous, quarrelsome lot of misery it would be hard to conceive.</p>

<p>The building, which is a large one, is divided into two
departments:—the "Hotel" and "Bum" sides of the house, as they are
locally known. The "Bum" side consists of a single large hall, located
in the rear, and separated entirely from the remainder of the house.
The "pay" department, is a well arranged, well furnished, and well
conducted hotel, principally patronized by permanent guests having
occupations in the city. The proceeds of the "Hotel" are supposed to
be devoted to the maintenance of the "Bum" department. "Bummers Hall"
has an average nightly attendance of two hundred and fifty impecunious
men every night in the year. Sometimes the number reaches to near
four hundred. Statistics are kept of the attendance. Single men
predominate, being above eighty per cent of those seeking the refuge.
The nationalities represented stand in the following order as to
numbers: Ireland, Germany, America and England; though all Europe has
delegates in "Bummers Hall." It has been often questioned if the resort
be not a detriment to the city, and an inducement for the fraternity
to rendezvous there. But this is not good reasoning. The tramps would
come whether the "Home" was there to receive them or no; and it is
far better to have two hundred and fifty impecunious—and frequently
lawless and reckless men—stowed safely away at night, than have them
thrown loose upon the city. It is a difficult matter to make tramping
a crime, for it would make poverty criminal. The suggestion that jails
and work-houses receive them is pernicious in the extreme. Reformatory
institutions turn out finished law-breakers. They generally reform a
man of what little good there may be in him when he enters them. The
great majority of tramps have not the <i>nerve</i> to commit a crime, though
they had the inclination. They are a poor, weak, purposeless, cowardly
set of vagabonds, whose most heinous offence consists in "jumping" a
train, or, perhaps, purloining some trifle of food. They shrink from
committing acts that will bring them before that terror of terrors, a
police court. But a term in the state's prison or work house turns out
quite a different individual. As tramps they still have latent hopes
(however futile) of some day recovering a membership in good society.
As prison graduates, this hope has left them, and they look viciously
upon life. As an evidence of this, it will be found that three-quarters
of the tramps arrested for unlawful acts, are released convicts.</p>

<p>There is a great hue and cry raised every now and then about "what
shall we do with them?" Better, if we turn our attentions to the
<i>cause</i> that produces the <i>effects</i>, and ask ourselves "what shall we
do with the system that makes them?"</p>

<p>Ben had scarcely time to look about and familiarize himself with the
place, when supper was announced. It consisted of a tin dish of soup
and a piece of bread, and was served up on the long table in the center
of the room. The soup was of the "<i>bouillon</i>" order. In it were sliced
carrots, stewed potatoes, boiled potato peelings, baked fish, chicken
bones, salt mackerel, cabbage, tomatoes, cheese, beef, beans, dried
apples, vegetable parings, and a few other articles. To the imaginative
mind it suggested the possibility of a small grocery store having gone
off on a drunk, and got drowned in a cauldron of boiling water. A more
practical view of the matter was that it consisted of the remnants of
the "Hotel side," with the kitchen dish water generously added, by way
of a flavor.</p>

<p>Though Ben had fasted all day, he declined partaking of it, and sat
toying with his iron spoon, and noticing the other guests. They had
not his squeamishness. The greater portion of the three hundred were
devoting a majesty of jaw bone to the work before them, highly edifying.</p>

<p>"The soup is extra to-night," remarked a veteran, as he fished up a
mass that might have been fish, flesh or fowl.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" responded a neighbor; "the best I've tasted since leaving
the rotisseries in the Rue de Gumbo!"</p>

<p>"I'll wait fur the toorkey wid the ister stuffin'," remarked another
who had finished his pan.</p>

<p>"Yez'll have to wait, thin, for it's Friday, an' there's no toorkey.
It'll be trout an' salmon, the day," returned a gentleman whose ragged
sleeve had evidently enjoyed the soup in company with its owner.</p>

<p>"What part of the fowl do you prefer, sir?" asked a polite tramp,
tendering Ben a section of a mackerel's back.</p>

<p>"Let the gentleman alone. The venison he had for dinner did not agree
with him," said a thin man, eyeing Ben's untasted soup longingly. Ben
saw the soup and presented him the panful, which made the thin man an
object of envy to all in that vicinity.</p>

<p>"Didn't I see you in Poverty Barn, in Cleveland?" asked a fat,
asthmatic tramp of Ben.</p>

<p>Our friend replied in the negative, when the asthmatic went into a
glowing description of the magnificence of "Poverty Barn, in Cleveland."</p>

<p>"It's behind the police station, Sor. Bunks three tier high, Sor. A
plank set on edge for a pillow in each of them, Sor. A big stove that
you can dry your clothes at, Sor. There's no knob on the inside of
the door, Sor. So when you get in you can't get out, Sor. It's a good
hangup, but no chuck, Sor. When you're in Cleveland don't fail to give
it a call, Sor. It's deserving of patronage, Sor."</p>

<p>Ben assured him that Poverty Barn should have his custom if business
took him to Cleveland.</p>

<p>"To hell mit Boverty Parn! I preaks my neck from vone of der punks down
comma, von night. Youst, when you go mit Cleveland, youst try der iron
vorks an' shleep in der varm sandt!" kindly advised a gentleman having
a pronounced Teutonic accent.</p>

<p>With much similar conversation, the meal drew to a close, the pans
were removed, and the long table turned, bottom-up, against the wall;
so that having banqueted off of the top side they might sleep on the
bottom. The benches were then arranged across the room, and an elderly
gentleman in black, with a clerical stock about his neck, (who was
irreverently greeted as "Old Blue Blazes") entered at a side door, at
the upper end of the hall, and proceeded to hold religious services. A
more orderly and attentive congregation than the three hundred tramps
composed, could not have been desired. This evening service was as much
a part of the charity as the soup, and should it have been omitted they
would have felt themselves defrauded. Cards, with the popular revival
hymns of the day printed on them, were distributed through the crowd,
and they lustily sang "Hold the Fort!" and "Pull for the Shore!"</p>

<p>The services concluded, preparations were made for retiring. Some of
the fastidious (generally the most ragged) spread a newspaper on the
floor to keep their clothes from getting soiled. Others contented
themselves with scraping a place free from tobacco quids, and retired
with their boots for a pillow.</p>

<p>There was one devotion peculiar to nearly all previous to closing their
eyes. Everyone indulged in a good <i>scratch</i>! That great luxury that
no unfeeling world could dispossess them of so long as they had their
hands. And <i>such</i> scratching! Such contortions in getting way round at
their backs; such grunts and sighs of satisfaction as both hands would
be vigorously applied to opposite extremities! And then the inventions
of genius—rubbing the back against a table leg while employing the
hands elsewhere; and using a foot and both hands at the same time! And
such courtesies—one scratching the unreachable portion of another, and
three and four scratching each other in a row! Ben was about the only
one present who did not scratch, and when a neighbor asked him to rub
his back with the sole of his boot he could not refuse the kindness;
so while he did not scratch himself, he aided others. Let him awake at
what hour of the night he might, there was scratching going forward in
some parts of the hall. Before daybreak, however, he found it congenial
to commence upon himself, and it took the closest application and
industry of search and slaughter, during the leisure moments of two
succeeding days, to prevent him from becoming a confirmed scratcher.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">INTRODUCES THE EVANGELIST.</p>


<p>That night was a memorable one for Ben. It is not often that a man
lies down to sleep, in full sight and hearing of three hundred of
his fellow mortals; not to mention three hundred with such peculiar
characteristics as separate the genus tramp from the rest of God's
creation.</p>

<p>Ben reclined on a hand and elbow, wide awake, listening to the various
noises proceeding from the sleepers. Snores, grunts, exclamations,
curses, prayer, laughter and writhing proceeded from the bodies
laboring under Dame Nature's mild anæsthetic. While so listening, a
tall, thin figure approached him. It was a pale, long-faced young man,
who had an air of dilapidated gentility about him, that was in unison
with his intelligent, but care-worn, face. Noticing Ben's wakefulness,
he said:</p>

<p>"I see that you, like myself, cannot sleep. What a pen of human swine
it is!" and he seated himself beside our friend.</p>

<p>"Which way are you travelling?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"I go west in the morning. Which direction are you taking?"</p>

<p>"I am going to St. Louis," answered Cleveland.</p>

<p>"Very well, we will go together. That suits me. I thought it would
be easiest to get on a coal fleet and go down the river with it, but
I find the fleet is hung up here for want of water, and there is no
telling when the river will raise. So we had best take the road for
it," observed the stranger.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to St. Louis?" inquired Ben.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied he, "several times."</p>

<p>"Tramped it?"</p>

<p>"Tramped it."</p>

<p>"But," hesitatingly suggested Ben, "you appear to be a man of
intelligence, I should think you could do better than leading the life
of a tramp."</p>

<p>"Think nothing of the sort," responded the stranger. "A man in this
world does just what he is fitted for. Habits, that I need not specify,
have drifted me into this life, and I am becoming confirmed in it."</p>

<p>"But do you not struggle against it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>do</i> struggle, but each struggle is weaker and weaker, and
shorter and shorter. You appear to be above the average tramp, and as
we are to travel together, I'll tell you some of my history without
asking any of your own in return. I had a fair education and studied
for the ministry. Until my mother died (and at mention of that sacred
name of mother his voice softened) I had something to live for, some
one to make proud of me. But on her death I was left alone in life,
and though homage comes from all the world, it can not give a mother's
praise. With a naturally unstable disposition I took to rambling, and I
have been rambling ever since."</p>

<p>"And do you never try to settle down; never attempt anything
permanent?" persisted Ben.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," returned the other with a laugh; "I have been reporter,
auctioneer, teamster, raftsman, railroader, clerk, stable-hand, and
Evangelist!"</p>

<p>"Evangelist!" exclaimed Cleveland.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied he, and immediately the "tramp" presented itself; "don't
you know the racket. Lots of the boys made a stake at it last year.
It's the Moody business gave them a starter. First they evangelized
themselves and then started out to evangelize others, with a weather
eye out for financial matters."</p>

<p>Ben was horrified! He had attended the Hippodrome meetings and been
greatly impressed with the work of the revivalists, and had never
connected a mercenary thought with them. This new development of using
revivals for money-making purposes grated harshly on his feelings, and
so he expressed himself.</p>

<p>"And why not?" asked the Evangelist. "People are willing to pay well
for being led to the devil, why should they not pay to be started on
the road to Heaven? It is singular that men should honor money-making
by all methods except the saving of their souls."</p>

<p>"But are the Evangelists engaged in money-making?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"To an extent—certainly. Why not? It is dishonest? Look-a-here, why
don't you view this matter practically? What's the use of giving it a
fictitious reputation? Is it dishonest? No. Why should not men make
money in doing good as well as in doing evil? Oh why should there be
any attempt to disguise the matter? There is where the mistake is
made, for it gives to good works a taint of deception. Do you for a
moment suppose the world does not see under the cloak of a '<i>call</i>'
the greed of gain! Why not be open and above board and say, '<i>We</i> do
this good for money'? Is honesty a crime? Indeed I half believe it
is. When I started as an Evangelist, I fixed a fair remuneration for
my services, and demanded it the same as I would wages for any other
work. What was the result. I was called mercenary, and people said I
not only laborized for the good of my fellow man, but for the good
of my pocket also. I was fool enough to acknowledge it, and shortly
found my services no longer in demand. Naturally I changed my tactics.
I no longer asked a stipulated remuneration. I was not after money.
But quietly determined that money should be after me. The result was
I received more in contributions than I ever could have obtained in
wages. Do you think people were not aware of my object just the same,
because I did not make a demand? Perhaps you will learn, as you journey
through life, that all the world wears a mask, and though the mask may
be transparent, it is highly impolitic to ask its removal. Humanity is
an ostrich, with its head in a sandbank!"</p>

<p>"Did you make it pay?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it paid well enough."</p>

<p>"Why did you not stick to it then?"</p>

<p>The brows of the dilapidated cynic contracted as he responded:</p>

<p>"Because from a child I have been unable to stick to anything. There is
no permanency in me. I am as shifting as running water. There, there;
you need not ask why I do not school myself to more stable habits; as I
am, I <i>am</i>; and be it fault or misfortune, so it is."</p>

<p>Ben's mental eye looked upon his new acquaintance through a fog. He
could not understand him. At the same time the thought suggested
itself to him: "What a purposeless, objectless life! What if my own
should shape itself to such a result!" and then the more encouraging
reflection came to him: "Better a tramp, with a New Orleans to be
attained, than a Ben Cleveland dozing life away on Smythe's lawn."</p>

<p>His new acquaintance having relieved himself of an over load of
cynicism proved to be a pleasant conversationalist, and a well informed
man. He was apparently a harmless creature, placed on earth to fill up
one of the chinks in its great social structure.</p>

<p>The breakfast in the morning was a repetition of the previous evening's
supper, save that the soup had fewer odds and ends in it. Though Ben
had refused the article the night before he found himself eating
heartily of it at the breakfast table, greatly to the disappointment of
the thin man, who had purposely secured a seat next to him, with hopes
based on his good fortune at the supper table. Alas, they were delusive
ones. Ben cleaned out his pan, and felt substantially full.</p>

<p>In company with the Evangelist he made his way to the city of
Alleghany, on the opposite side of the river of that name, and there
the two had a council of war. It was finally agreed that they should
walk that day, and reach some point where a train could be boarded
during the evening. Accordingly they followed the track that borders
the Ohio, until within an hour of sunset, when they found themselves
near the town of Economy; a settlement of industrious Germans who are
trying so to live that the transition from life to death will be hardly
noticeable, save that it causes the reflection that for all intents
and purposes they might as well have been born dead. It is a communal
settlement, and propagation is unknown. By strict frugality, industry
and the natural growth of wealth much money has been amassed, and the
riches undoubtedly give them all the enjoyment of possession. One of
these days when the last Economist shall have departed for Eternity,
with his shekel done up in a napkin, there will be a delightful hubbub
over the ownership of the thousands they have accumulated.</p>

<p>Before reaching the settlement our travellers were met by a lone tramp,
on his way to New York City, for the purpose of viewing the abutments
of the East River bridge. He had heard and read so much about that
structure, while summering in the vicinity of St. Paul, that his
curiosity was aroused, and he thought to have a look at it.</p>

<p>"I have not come from Minnesota direct," he explained; "I went to
St. Louis to see the bridge Eads built so as I could compare the
two. I takes a great interest in public works, and more 'specially
engineering. Sometimes I think I'd a made a good bridge builder
myself, but I served my time in a bakery, and never had no inclination
for bread, 'cept to eat it." He might further have stated that being a
gentleman of impecunious leisure, and time not being money with him,
he had all the advantages necessary for indulging his penchant for
investigating public works.</p>

<p>"You're near Economy now," he continued, "and you can stop over night
with the 'brothers.' I'll tell you how you can do it. Old 'brother'
Rapp will meet you and he'll say 'no.' Then you just ask him to give
you a few matches, and when he asks what for, say it's to build a fire
and cook you something to eat and sleep by, and you'll see how quick
he'll ask you to come in and stop. So long." And the tourist again
resumed his way toward the East River bridge. Ben and his comrade had
no intention of remaining over night in Economy, however. They took
supper there though, being hospitably received and treated to plenty
of fresh coarse bread, cheese and smoked sausage, the latter so hard
that it would have made a dent in an oak plank. Politely thanking their
entertainers they resumed the track in the balmy dusk of evening,
listening to Nature's vesper hymn.</p>

<p>Along the roadway, and from swamp and pasture and woodland, came the
chorus of a million throats. The deep base of some old patriarchal
serenader heightened the treble of the noisy newts. Afar off the tinkle
of a cow bell floated softly over the hills; the rustling of dried
leaves; the snapping of a fallen bough: the owl's whoop from out his
hermit dell; the beetle's never changing drone; the call of katydid,
and the mournful notes of the whip-poor-will, all mingled in the
evening service; and the heart of Ben stopped to listen, and all the
sophistry, cynicism and doubtings that this world possesses, could not
at that moment have prevented him from thinking that this life is not
the be-all and the end-all, here; but that far, far beyond the star lit
girdle of earth there is another, a better, and a purer one.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">AN UNCOMFORTABLE NIGHT.</p>


<p>The two travellers boarded a western bound freight train at Brighton.
There being no accessible box car, they were compelled to content
themselves with a seat on the rear steps of the caboose, where they
were discovered and incontinently "bounced" after being carried some
twenty miles. Ben thought this ejectment finished their ride on that
train, but the Evangelist—whose name was Horton—corrected him.
Creeping along in the shadow of the train until it started, they again
seated themselves on the steps. This time they made but ten miles,
before they were discovered, when some strong adjectives were used, and
some hard names called, and they were warned if caught on the train
again they would be dealt with in a most summary manner.</p>

<p>"Wait for another train!" exclaimed the Evangelist. "Certainly not—why
we have only been bounced <i>twice</i>!"</p>

<p>He instructed Ben to crouch under the cars at the centre of the train,
and when it started walk with it, so long as he could keep up. When he
found the rate of speed getting too much for him, he was to mount a
ladder, but not put in appearance on the roof until positive that the
crew was not around.</p>

<p>The crew of a freight train consists of the fireman and engineer, who
remain in the locomotive's cab; a conductor who, while the train is in
motion, generally remains in his caboose, and two brakeman—front and
rear—supposed to remain on top, but who, after the train has started,
usually betake themselves to the engine-cab and caboose respectively.
On the night runs all carry lanterns, and through them their approach
is easily discernible by the sly tramp. It will now be understood why
Ben was to delay mounting to the top.</p>

<p>Having clung to the ladder for some time he slowly raised his head
above the roof and surveyed the situation. Not a light appeared in
sight, but on the next car he saw the dark outlines of a man, and heard
the Evangelist crooning to himself a revival hymn. He mounted to the
roof, and both men sat down immediately over their respective ladders,
ready to go down them on the slightest provocation. Much after the
fashion of prairie-dogs, sitting at the mouth of their holes, prepared
at the faintest disturbance to show a clean pair of heels and faint
whisk of a tail. Several times during the ensuing hour the light of
the front brakeman appeared as that individual attended to easing the
train down grades. And each time our two travellers suddenly disappear;
reappearing again when the coast was clear. Having gone about sixteen
miles, the train side tracked to allow an eastern-bound express to
pass. Ben and his companion crouched under the cars until they again
started, when the ladders were resumed and ultimately the roof.</p>

<p>This method of travelling seemed quite pleasant to him and he was
beginning to rest more at ease, and recline on his back, when a
note of warning from the Evangelist aroused him, and glancing along
the train he perceived lights approaching from both directions. The
tramps immediately disappeared in the darkness, while the conductor
and front brakeman met on the identical car to which our friend Ben
was clinging. After some instructions had been given the brakeman,
the political disquietudes of the day became a topic of conversation,
and so interested did they become, that placing their lanterns on the
roof they sat down themselves, to the intense disgust of our friend,
who dared not elevate his head. Unfortunately for him the train was
a through freight and had just entered on one of the longest runs of
the division. The perch that had been comfortable enough for a short
occupancy, soon became quite unendurable with the continued jolting
of the car. His feet grew stiff and his hands sore. Besides he had
to cling close to the ladder in constant terror lest the timbers of
the bridges they frequently crossed should sweep him off. To add to
his misery both of the train men were great consumers of tobacco, and
facing Ben's ladder they poured upon his devoted head a torrent of
tobacco juice. Moments grew to the dignity of hours, minutes to ages.
Never had he been so thoroughly disgusted with politics. He wished he
belonged to a despotism where the discussion of them was punishable
with death. Not only dared he not elevate his head, but he was afraid
to turn his face skywards at all, lest he receive in the eyes and mouth
a charge of the amber juice that was being so liberally bestowed upon
him.</p>

<p>Our hero was certainly in an unenviable position. If he ascended to
the roof and gave himself up, the conductor had threatened in case he
was again caught on the train to hand him over to the authorities the
first stop that was made; a procedure that, under the vagrant laws
would insure him ninety days in the work house; enough to totally wreck
his expectations. On the other hand if he fell to the ground he was
sure to be either killed or badly mangled. In this sad predicament his
over-strained feelings found vent in a groan.</p>

<p>Railroad men, as a class, are superstitious. There are spots along
each crews' route that are vested with supernatural properties. We
knew a practical man of good common-sense, an engineer, who solemnly
avers that on crossing a certain bridge at midnight, a large white
dog always springs across the track immediately his engine leaves the
bridge. Another man, a brakeman, would have deserted his train sooner
than omit changing his lantern three times, from his right hand into
his left, the first time he walked the train. Whatever it is in the
human fabrication that yearns after the incomprehensible we know not;
but that such a force is established there is verified by the scores of
different religious beliefs;—founded on faith or fancy—as you please.</p>

<p>The Administration was receiving a hearty endorsement from the
conductor when Ben's groan struck on his ear. A sudden silence ensued.
The conductor looked at the brakeman, and the brakeman looked at the
conductor. Neither spoke. Another smothered groan came floating from
out the surrounding darkness. The conductor was suddenly reminded that
his way bills needed overhauling and the brakeman discovered that his
presence was needed at the front of the train. Ben was left master of
the situation, though unaware of the influence his groans had had in
placing him there. He dragged his stiffened limbs to the top of the
car, and indulged in a luxurious rub of his bespattered countenance.
Presently he was joined by the Evangelist and the two recounted their
experiences.</p>

<p>By constant watchfulness and much dodging down the ladders, they
retained possession of the train during the night, and the first
glimpses of the morning sun found them at Columbus; having made over
one hundred and twenty miles on the train Ben had thought it impossible
to ride. Stiff, sore, tired and sleepy, but in possession of the
satisfaction of having taken a long step on their journey, our friends
dismounted and took a look around them. While they still stood by the
train the conductor passed. He gave them one look of astonishment, and
with the remark, "Well, I'll be blowed!" went on his way.</p>

<p>As they stood staring about them, not knowing just what to do or where
to turn their steps, a man approached, ringing an old cow bell.</p>

<p>"Just come in on the train, gentlemen?" asked this individual with a
polite bow and monkey-like grin.</p>

<p>The travellers replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Wish to put up at a hotel? Right this way. First-class house. Hotel de
Log! On the European plan. Patronized by the elite. Table spread with
all the delicacies of the season, and the best the market affords. My
clerk was out to a ball last night, and I have to attend to the trains
myself this morning. Any baggage? I'll send the porter after it. Just
follow me. Breakfast is ready. You are just in time. Right this way,
gentlemen. Allow me to carry your coat, sir." This last to Ben, who
immediately professed to be competent to carry it himself.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied he of the cow bell; "come right along. You
gentlemen also"; to two terrible looking tramps, that it was afterwards
discovered had been on the train all the way from Pittsburg, riding
bumpers and trucks.</p>

<p>Curiosity caused the travellers to follow the proprietor of Hotel de
Log. He led them some distance down the track, and then struck across
an open field to a piece of scrub timber, traversed by a brook. A short
walk in this patch of woodland revealed the hotel.</p>

<p>A giant sycamore had bowed its aged head to some western tornado, and
lay at length upon the ground, parallel with the brook, and about a
rod from its brawling waters. Along the brook side of the tree were
stretched, upon beds of boughs and leaves a dozen or more men, while
two others stirred up the embers of a fire, near them. There were
countless empty tin cans—fire scorched and battered—empty bottles
of every degree of gentility, from the aristocratic, thick bellied
champagne bottle, down to the plebeian blue glass pop, and an iron pot
or two, while rags, bones, and scraps of cold victuals, littered the
ground; and in the log stuck a piece of broken looking-glass with a
fragment of horn comb behind it.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said their guide with a courteous wave of the cow bell,
"allow me; <i>The Hotel de Log!</i> Make yourselves to home."</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">THE HOTEL DE LOG.</p>


<p>Ben and the Evangelist broke out in a roar of laughter, that caused
one of the sleepers to awake and murmur a protest, and the proprietor
of the "Hotel" to request them to suppress their hilarity lest they
disturb some of the sleepers on the ground floor.</p>

<p>So our travellers bottled up their mirth and proceeded to make
themselves at home, by taking a sleep that their exhausted natures
loudly demanded. Having secured apartments near the fire, they scraped
away such articles as encumbered the ground, and gathering together
some leaves and branches for beds, were soon lost in a sound slumber.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the Hotel de Log was quite a character. He was a
professional tramp and journeyman painter, who, being of a sociable
turn of mind, had found congenial pastime in establishing and
maintaining this popular resort. Originally he had camped on the spot
alone, lame with a foot sore from the effects of travel. Passing tramps
had been attracted to his camp-fire, and in their stories of the foot
path and tales of adventures he had found the true pleasure that his
nature craved. From tramp to tramp, along the line of track, the word
had passed where good camping ground was to be found, and the Hotel
de Log never lacked guests. Hotel keeping became a mania with the
painter-tramp. He secured an old cow bell and regularly visited all
freight trains—those being the vehicles generally patronized by his
customers—and invited members of the fraternity who were intending to
stop off down to his mansion on the sunny side of the grey sycamore.
He was a harmless, good-natured little fellow, and liked by the
respectable community residing in the vicinity; for, to an extent, he
controlled the disorderly vagabond element that gathered about him.
The citizens gave him such scraps of food as they could spare, and his
boarders went out on "cadjing" pilgrimages, and returned well ladened.
He was generous to a fault, and had a kind, gentle hand for the wounded
and afflicted among his guests. The one great luxury of his life, was
the occasional indulgence in a quiet, solemn drunk, during which he
would sit nodding by the brook, and holding pleasant converse with its
laughing waters.</p>

<p>Who knows but the little man was filling the very spot the Creator had
moulded him for. If nothing is made in vain, why should this little
painter-tramp have been?</p>

<p>Heaven only knows where he now is. But it is safe to venture the
suggestion that if his cow bell is rusting in the grass grown court
yard of his hotel, and the thrush sings undisturbed upon its walls of
sycamore, there are other bells in distant lands that will welcome the
poor little painter to a mansion paved with gold and glittering with
precious stones. A mansion like his quaint Hotel de Log—not made by
human hands.</p>

<p>Better, perhaps, apply for admission at the gates of that Great
Hostelry, bearing with you the odor of kind deeds and the sanctity of a
generous heart, than with all the pretentions of a successful life and
most respectable burial, supplemented by a shaft of marble that shall
hand your virtues to posterity in as cold and useless a shape as they
existed while you were alive.</p>

<p>When Ben awoke the sun had passed meridian. The Evangelist still slept,
and around the fire lounged two tramps with wounds upon their legs
caused by unattended bruises received in boarding trains. The rest of
the guests had flown.</p>

<p>Ben felt much refreshed by his slumber. One of the invalids asked for
tobacco and he gave them both a generous supply. In return they spread
before him the contents of the larder, consisting of bread, newly dug
potatoes, roasting ears, and a jug of cider. The proprietor, he was
informed, had departed early in the forenoon to attend a neighboring
carpet beating, to which he had been invited. When the Evangelist
awoke he also partook of like fare. At his suggestion, Ben boiled some
water in an iron pot, and with a wash tub—improvised out of half a
barrel—they washed their undergarments by the brook, and spread them
in the sun to dry.</p>

<p>One of the invalids suggested if they were "<i>crumbie</i>" they had best
give their clothes a "dry wash," and further explained that a dry wash
consisted in spreading their garments over a village of ant hills, and
allowing those useful little scavengers to go through them and carry
off the parasites, both full grown and in protoplasm. Fortunately the
"dry wash" had not yet become a necessity with either.</p>

<p>Being informed that a water tank, conveniently situated for "jumping"
trains, was located some seven miles to the west, our two travellers
left the Hotel de Log late in the afternoon—before the proprietor
returned—and started for it.</p>

<p>The night that followed was an active and eventful one. The two were
repeatedly put off of trains, and after having tried bumpers, pilots,
ladders and roofs—during which they managed to travel some forty
miles—they at last, about midnight, seated themselves upon the front
platform of the lightning express baggage car, and made fifty miles
without a stop. But, unfortunately, when they attempted to renew their
place, the train side tracked, and they were discovered. An exciting
chase between the tramps and several road officials followed, but
eluding their pursuers, and convinced that it was impracticable to
board a train at that depot, they took to the road and walked several
miles until they came to an inviting haystack, when both lay down and
slept.</p>

<p>Ben had now passed through the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and
Ohio, and was on the border of Indiana. He had travelled over seven
hundred miles in six days, and St. Louis was within a little more than
three hundred more in a bee line, but nearer five hundred by the route
and in the manner he was compelled to go. So far his success had been
encouraging. Should it continue he felt confident of accomplishing his
task. Those six days had accomplished a wonderful change in him. He was
ragged and dirty, and no longer cared for appearances. He was now an
expert in stealing rides. There was a bold, lawless, vagabond feeling
gaining an ascendancy over him. He was fast losing the self respect
that cares for the opinions of others. His stomach had accustomed
itself to the new <i>regime</i>. He ate voraciously when he could obtain
food in plenty, and found himself fasting an entire twenty-four hours
without any very disagreeable sensations. He was no longer afraid to
ask for food, nor ashamed of being ordered roughly from a train or its
vicinity. He cared nothing about the stares with which he was greeted;
an Ishmaelitish feeling was growing upon him—and he did not care to
repress it. In fact Ben had become a <i>tramp</i>.</p>

<p>His new companion, the Evangelist, was a sociable, easy-going,
good-natured fellow. He had traits that were peculiar. Differing from
the majority of tramps, he never uttered an oath. "I promised my dear,
good mother, when a child, that I would not swear, and I never have,"
he said.</p>

<p>His love and respect for his mother's memory was something sublime,
amid his rags and degradation. He never spoke disrespectfully of her
sex, nor would he allow others to. He mentioned her often in the most
devoted manner, and it was easy to be seen that she was the idol of his
life. Though a cynic and a skeptic he once said to Ben:</p>

<p>"Were I positive that there was no hereafter, I would school myself to
think otherwise. For of what use would life be to me did I not have the
hope of again being by the side of her who has gone before me?" And on
another occasion he said:</p>

<p>"I like free-thinkers well enough, and freedom of thought. I would not
that any one should be bound down to the slavery of creed or dogma. Nor
do I believe that any one poor, weak piece of human clay has a right to
dictate the road to immortality, or sit in judgment on a fellow being.
But he who wrecks a comforting belief or destroys a solacing faith,
ruins that which he cannot replace. He takes away a happiness and
offers nothing in return. It is a despicable act. A man had better let
the creed or faith of his neighbor alone."</p>

<p>Horton had no aims, no ambitions, no aspirations. His was a harmless,
purposeless life. An inoffensive vagabond who first excited your
contempt, and then won your pity. His mother had been left a widow, in
poverty, when he was a babe, and with her needle, supported herself and
child. All his mother's hopes were centered in him; all his childish
love in her. She struggled hard to give him a fair education, and the
happiest moment of her life was when her boy entered a theological
seminary. Up to that time Horton had been a more than usually bright
and promising boy. Whatever he did was done "for mother's sake," and
all his air-castles were occupied by her. While he was at the seminary
she died, and he never recovered from the blow. A dull, dead apathy to
all about him was succeeded by a mild cynicism and a sad rebellion
against the justice of Providence; which latter caused his speedy
expulsion from the theological school, about which he cared nothing,
however.</p>

<p>"Why could not my mother have been left to me?" he would say. "Had not
sorrows, toils and trials enough been heaped upon her dear head, but
that just as I was becoming a value and a consolation to her she must
be taken from me and I from her?"</p>

<p>When told that "the Lord chasteneth those he loveth," he would bitterly
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Then I want nothing to do with such a God! It is man's God. Created
by himself, and like himself, a thing of fury and vengeance! No, no,
no. Him who lights the stars in the sky, and in whose hand this world
is a mite so small that his Almighty eye alone can see it, is not the
base, slaughter-thirsty creation poor, weak mortals attempt to depict
in words that flavor of the dust of earth and thoughts that cannot go
beyond the grave!"</p>

<p>It was probably a lack of discretion on his part, and a pernicious
habit of speaking out his thoughts, that brought Horton into disrepute
with respectable people when he chanced to stop among them. For men
and women do not like to have people—especially poor and dependent
people—set up in the thinking business for themselves, while so much
labor and money has been expended to have their thinking done for them;
it looks presumptuous and ungrateful.</p>

<p>The Evangelist had an old silver watch that had belonged to his father.
It had been the family time piece of the little home formed by his
adored mother and himself, and through all the vicissitudes of his
rambling life he had managed to retain it. It was the connecting link
between himself and a past respectability.</p>

<p>Ben had taken a great liking to the fellow, and often spoke to him
seriously about reforming his vagabond career, and becoming a decent
member of society. But Horton's sophistry was too much for him.</p>

<p>"Drones are not the worst inhabitants of this great hive, called the
world," he would say laughingly. "Drones are consumers, and the more
consumers and fewer producers, the better times are. This country was
never so busy at work as when it had a million of non-productive men
in the field, to take care of. As a vagabond, I support others by
compelling others to support me."</p>

<p>Ben's words evidently at times had some effect on him, however, and set
him to doing much quiet thinking.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE EVANGELIST INVESTS IN A HORSE.</p>


<p>A rather unprofitable journey by daylight was attempted, with but
little success. The trains were so closely watched that they found it
next to impossible to ride on them. Some tramps, whom they met on foot,
informed them that this was on account of a fracas that had occurred
on the western end of the line. The train men were expelling some
free-riders, and handling one of them very roughly the tramp drew a
knife and plunged it into the side of a brakeman. The wounded man was
not expected to recover, and very strict orders had been issued by the
management of the road to prevent all tramps from boarding trains or
riding upon them.</p>

<p>This being the case the Evangelist suggested that they strike across
the country, and get on another railroad, running nearly parallel,
fifty miles to the south of them.</p>

<p>They walked quite a distance that evening, and camped in a straw pile.
On the following day they resumed their line of march through a lovely
rolling country of openings, woodlands and meadows, interspersed by
many streams.</p>

<p>It was the middle of September—the golden time of all the year. The
atmosphere was filled with a soft, hazy lustre; the reflex heat of
the summer months after it had journeyed so far as the ice fields
of the far north, and been turned back in a soft and gracious air.
Gentle winds told forest tales among the tall trees, and nodded the
heads of the grey mullens in requiem over the great, broad, plush-like
leaves that lay dying at the foot of the stalks. Sentinel sheaves of
wheat stood grouped about the yellow fields, and from out the stubble
came the piping of the quail mingling with the rustling of the long,
drooping, corn leaves; a mellow, autumnal refrain. Near at hand the
chattering brook ran a messenger of harvest-time to the far off river,
and the river carried the news to the gulf, and the gulf swept it to
the four corners of the earth.</p>

<p>The lovely quiet of the country gave our travellers a feeling of peace
and rest, that the sharp voice of the iron horse and the rattle of his
steel-shod hoofs had forbidden them.</p>

<p>"This it is that makes tramping glorious!" exclaimed the Evangelist,
imbued with the beauty and placidity of Nature's feast.</p>

<p>"'Far from the maddening crowd's ignoble strife' I could tramp forever
and forever, with Nature for a companion, and feed my hungry eyes on
her loveliness!"</p>

<p>Toward the close of the afternoon, as Ben and his friend were seated,
resting on the top rail of an old, moss-covered, stake-and-rider fence,
a young man came up to them mounted on a horse. The animal was without
a saddle and looked as though he had been severely ridden. His rider
appeared to be an ordinary young country fellow, without any particular
points of interest about him. He drew rein opposite our friends and
entered into conversation with them, stating that he was a resident of
Bonfield in the adjoining county, thirty miles distant, and having had
a falling out with the old folks at home, had left the parental roof
with this horse—his only property—determined to seek his fortunes
abroad; ef it tuk him through six 'jining counties! But he found the
horse to be a plaguy botheration. He'd no saddle, an' he was too poor
to buy one, and too poor to afford the luxury of a ridin'. He could
better afford to walk. He said he was a simple feller and didn't
know much 'bout the world, no how, which they might a seed. He was
detarmined to sell or dicker his hoss, and mebbe they'd like to buy
the anamyle. How much w'uld they give fur him? But our friends had no
money to purchase him with even had they been so inclined. In that case
moughtn't they hev sumthin' they'd trade? For the rider was so durned
tired of the bruit, durned if he didn't nigh feel like givin' him away,
or a tradin' him fur sum durned jack knife! Our friends had nothing to
trade him, however.</p>

<p>No pistols, nor watches, nor jewelry, nor nothing?</p>

<p>Ben shook his head, but the Evangelist studied a moment.</p>

<p>"Ben," he whispered, "I hate to part with my watch. It is the last
earthly tie I have binding me to memories of the past. But—if—if I
had that horse I could sell him—sell him may be for fifty or sixty
dollars! And that would be money enough to take us both decently
to St. Louis, and pay our expenses there until we could secure
employment—<i>good</i> employment. I'd give up rambling, and—it might be
the making of us both!"</p>

<p>Cleveland tried to persuade him not to part with the watch, but the
sanguine temperament of the Evangelist—peculiar to him—was already
picturing a life of respectability in St. Louis. A great reformation
with Ben for a constant moral support to lean upon. Indeed it was Ben's
own reasoning heretofore that caused the other to think at all of
changing his condition.</p>

<p>"Yes I will, yes I will, Ben. It's a great chance—who knows what may
come of it!"</p>

<p>And Ben who had formed a strong liking for his companion thought
perhaps it might be for the best after all. That it might, possibly, be
a turning point in Horton's life, that would redeem him.</p>

<p>The watch was scarce worth twenty dollars. It had heavy, old-fashioned
silver cases, but the works—though in good order—were antique. Horton
offered it to the rider for his horse, and the latter, after dickering
for something "to boot," and finding he could get nothing more,
accepted it. Then he transferred the horse to the Evangelist, calling
upon Ben to be a witness to the trade, and bidding our friends good
day, stated that he wished to pass the night with a cousin six miles
distant, and struck out over the fields.</p>

<p>The two travellers took a look at their new acquisition. He was a
trifle old, and had a bone spavin, but otherwise was a good, solid
chunk of a farm horse. The question now arose what to do with him.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said Horton, "it is about twelve miles to Lickskillet,
where we strike the railroad. That is too far for you to walk to-night,
but I can ride, and get into the town an hour or so before sundown,
by pushing my horse. I'll sell him there for all I can get, and wait
for you. You walk so far as you feel able to-night and get up early
to-morrow morning and come on," and then after a pause: "Don't delay
Ben, for it aint just safe for me to have money about me yet—my good
resolutions are too new," and he laughed, but his voice was serious and
entreating.</p>

<p>This arrangement being perfected the Evangelist mounted his purchase
and rode off at a sharp canter, Ben following more slowly on foot.</p>

<p>Now that Horton was gone our hero discovered what a companion he
had been. Always ready with some quaint suggestion or far-fetched
argument—original in his metaphors and epigrammatic in his
criticisms—he had caused the time to pass away agreeably, and Ben
missed him.</p>

<p>With pleasant reveries he beguiled the way until sundown came upon him
unnoticed. He could have made Lickskillet that night by an increase of
exertion, but his feet were tired and as there was no necessity for
getting into the town until morning, he began looking about him for
a camping place. While prospecting for a straw pile, or hay stack,
suitably situated for his night's rest, he passed a comfortable farm
house, consisting of a frame building with a log kitchen in its rear.
In the barn yard, near the house, a man was attempting to raise a corn
crib by means of two timbers used as levers. The method did not appear
to work well, and Ben watched him through several failures. He would
first bear down one of his levers, and piling stones upon it attempt to
hold it in this manner, while he lifted on the other. But the levers
slipped, and he was unsuccessful. He had worked fruitlessly long enough
to make help appreciated, and when Ben offered his assistance, it was
gladly accepted. It took nearly an hour's labor to get the corn crib
into the desired position and properly propped up.</p>

<p>When the work was done, the farmer thanked him and asked if he was
travelling.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'm on my way to St. Louis."</p>

<p>"Wall, I declar! Reckon you'll git thar twixt now and Chris'mas?"</p>

<p>Ben reckoned he would.</p>

<p>"I declar! No money?"</p>

<p>"No money."</p>

<p>"Turrible bad condition, I declar! Come in and take a bite; ye've arned
yer supper. I ain't got no great show of 'commodations, but these
nights air not cold, an' thar's a plenty of fresh straw out in the cow
shed. Reckon ye kin make out? Hey, not?"</p>

<p>Ben assured him that the accommodations offered were highly acceptable.</p>

<p>"And whar mought ye come frum?" asked the farmer.</p>

<p>"New York," replied Ben.</p>

<p>"I declar! State or city?"</p>

<p>"City."</p>

<p>"I declar!" And he looked at Ben and Ben looked at him. "That's a right
smart piece frum hyar, I reckon?"</p>

<p>Ben told him it was nearly eight hundred miles, at which he "declar'd!"
again.</p>

<p>On entering the farm house he was introduced to the farmer's wife, and
four small tow-headed children, with the remark:</p>

<p>"Fly round, 'Riah; hyar's a man all the way frum New Yurk City agoin'
to St. Lowis; an' I'm turrible peckish, which I reckon he is too," at
which 'Riah also said "I declar!" and the four tow-headed children
stood with open mouths and looked it, though they did not say so.</p>

<p>At the table the farmer turned to Ben, somewhat to the latter's
consternation, and asked:</p>

<p>"Strangier, will you say a blessin'?"</p>

<p>Ben might have recited some Homeric ode, but a simple blessing left him
high and dry on the shoals of ignorance, and he had to decline.</p>

<p>The good man came near saying "I declar!" but corrected himself, and
proceeded to ask divine protection for himself and family and the
stranger within his gates, interpolating a few reflections upon his
oldest son and heir's reprehensible act of sticking his fingers in the
"meat gravy," and introducing in the invocation a promise to give the
two youngest tow heads "a good larrupin' fur their obstreporosity of
behaviour." Grace having been duly wound up by the head of the family
smartly rapping the tow head nearest to him with his knuckles, for an
infraction of proprieties, Ben was solicited not to stand on ceremony,
but to "pitch in."</p>

<p>After supper a pipe and a chat by a log fire—more for light and
cheerfulness than heat—followed. But our hero soon grew sleepy, tired
out with the day's long walk, and retired to the cow shed determined to
be up and away at early cock crow in the morning.</p>

<p>Sometime during the night he was partially awakened from his slumbers
by voices on the kitchen porch. Half asleep and half awake he heard the
following disjointed expressions:</p>

<p>"He's caught—Lickskillet jail—they're all a coming—'greed to it
after meetin'—make an example of him—we'll show 'em—come on—be
quick!" After which he was dimly conscious that some one entered the
barn and saddled a horse. There was a clatter of hoofs out on the road,
and then all was again quiet, and Ben slept peacefully.</p>

<p>It was the dark hour before dawn when the restless chanticleer from
his perch in a neighboring apple tree called our hero up. He limbered
himself with a good round of shakes and stamping life into his sleepy
feet, started out in the dark for Lickskillet, five miles distant.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">LICKSKILLET HAS A SENSATION.</p>


<p>Though this is a true and faithful chronicle of the adventures of our
friend Benjamin Cleveland, so closely have his affairs now become
linked with the destiny of another that we must temporarily leave him,
and turn to the hamlet of Lickskillet.</p>

<p>When the Evangelist arrived with his horse late the previous afternoon,
he found the village to consist of a single straggling street, lined
by country stores, in front of which were hitched a few farm teams and
country wagons. The Evangelist was stared at after the usual bucolic
fashion. His immediate business being the disposal of his equine
property, he rode up to a long, low, weather-stained building, bearing
the legend, "Livery, board and sale stable," in skeleton characters on
a board that decorated a pole. Half a dozen loungers greeted his advent
with a stolid stare.</p>

<p>Horton rode into the building and dismounting, propounded the question:</p>

<p>"Does anybody know of anybody that wants to buy a horse?"</p>

<p>Another stare, more dense in its stupidity and stolidity, greeted the
query.</p>

<p>"If they do, here's a solid good work horse I'll sell cheap," continued
he.</p>

<p>At this information a man, who had been engaging his time and attention
in company with an intelligent jack knife, upon a shingle, arose, and
allowing his hand and knife to pare away at the wood after their own
inclination, walked slowly around the horse and observed him with a
critical eye.</p>

<p>"Whar'd ye get him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Bought him of a man up the road," replied Horton. "I got him at a
bargain, and I'll sell him at one."</p>

<p>"How much?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"I'll sell him for fifty dollars, cash," said the Evangelist.</p>

<p>The man stared at Horton a full minute without speaking, slowly running
his eye from the Evangelist's head to his feet and up again several
times. Then, still whittling, he walked to the barn door, where he
turned and gave a sly wink to one of the stolid men present; which
pantomimic piece of activity seemed to create some little sensation
among the human stolidity present.</p>

<p>One after another they arose, and slowly walking around the horse, eyed
him from head to tail, then giving Horton a final examination, passed
quietly out of the door, until the latter found himself left alone with
his horse.</p>

<p>This situation lasted but a few moments, for the man who first went out
shortly returned, still whittling, and commenced interrogating him.</p>

<p>"Whar did ye kum frum? Whar air ye goin'? How long ye hed the animyle?
Wot ye want to sell it fur? How'd he kum to be rid so hard?" and
numerous other questions were asked and duly answered. Having finished
his category, the stable-keeper—for it was the owner and proprietor of
the "livery"—remarked:</p>

<p>"Looks mighty 'spicious!"</p>

<p>"What looks suspicious?" asked Horton.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," replied the man with a tone and look indicating that his
yahoo mind was one immense volume of doubt.</p>

<p>The Evangelist was puzzled. He could see nothing strange about the
matter, and so expressed himself. If a man wanted a good horse cheap,
there was the animal—and if he did not, he could let it alone. A
liberty of action that would no doubt have powerfully impressed the
"'spicious" man were it not that the attention of both was suddenly
diverted into other channels. There were heard the murmur of many
voices, and the shuffling of many feet on the street, and half a
hundred men, picked up from farmers' wagons, trading stores and
adjacent fields, rushed into the stable and surrounded Horton and
the horse. While he was staring in astonishment at this influx of
purchasers, a lank, sandy-complexioned man stepped from the crowd and
taking one look at the horse, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That's him! Whoa, Bob!"</p>

<p>The animal immediately recognizing the voice and name, turned his head
and greeted the sandy man with a neigh.</p>

<p>At this Horton stepped back in astonishment, but the next instant was
felled to the stable floor by a blow on the head, and three men pounced
upon him, crying out:</p>

<p>"No you don't, you scoundrel! You're too late! We've got ye and'll keep
ye! You bet!"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," cried the Evangelist so soon as he could recover breath,
"What in the name of Heaven does all this mean?"</p>

<p>"Mean!" exclaimed half a dozen voices, while a score of angry eyes
glared vengefully upon him; "Mean? Why it means ye're gone up, ye whelp
of a hoss thief!"</p>

<p>"I am no thief!" he indignantly replied. "That horse is my property,
and I came by him honestly."</p>

<p>"Ye lie!" shouted he of the sandy complexion, who was now holding
'Bob.' "Ye lie! Ye stole that hoss outer my cow lot night afore last,
I kem from Spoonerville down the town-line rud or I'd hev cot ye on
the way, an' ef I hed the county ud hev been saved the expense of yer
trial!" And giving utterance to this dark shadowing of a vengeful
purpose the sandy man glared upon Horton.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen it is <i>false</i>! I—" commenced the Evangelist, but the sandy
man, unable to reach him with his hands and hold his horse at the same
time, gave the poor captive a vicious kick in the stomach, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Ye mean to tell me <i>I lie</i>, ye dirty, hoss thief!"</p>

<p>One would have thought that in that crowd some voice had been found
to call "shame" at the cowardly act of striking a man held from self
defence by the hands of others. But the agricultural sense of honor
is somewhat like the agricultural habits of life—somewhat narrowed by
limited associations. Had the good feelings of the crowd been appealed
to they would all have rushed after a leader like a flock of sheep,
probably. It being the opposite, Horton was kicked and cuffed to their
heart's content, as though each had a private grievance to attend to.
They then stood him on his feet and demanded that he give an account of
himself.</p>

<p>Thoroughly frightened and suffering much pain from the harsh treatment
he had received, and fearing a repetition of it that seemed to indicate
itself in the lowering looks surrounding him, the poor unfortunate
Evangelist humbled his tone, and gave a truthful statement of himself
and the manner in which he had obtained possession of the horse.
Briefly he stated who he was and did not try to palliate the crime of
being a tramp. Then he related how, while in company with Ben, he had
traded a watch for the horse with a farmer's boy who lived in Bonfield,
and had brought the animal in town to sell it; leaving his comrade back
on the road, to come after him on the morrow.</p>

<p>"A likely story!"</p>

<p>"Did he think to stuff that down their throats?"</p>

<p>"A man without money having watches to give for horses! Too thin!"</p>

<p>"Where was his partner?"</p>

<p>"Selling another horse somewhere, probably!"</p>

<p>"He said he was a tramp, and what was a tramp but a hoss thief!"</p>

<p>And they laughed at his statements in derision. The tide was netting
strong against the Evangelist. It became a perfect torrent when the
sandy complexioned man called upon another sandy-complexioned man,
with sandy hair and sandy beard and sandy clothes, and small sandy
blue eyes, and hard sandy hands (honest, no doubt, but very ragged at
the finger ends and very dirt-grimed) and a sandy voice, and sandy
appearance generally from his heel to his occiput, to come take a good
"squar" look at Horton, and see if he was not the man he had seen
loafing around in the vicinity of Spoonerville? And this sandiest of
all sandy men, feeling himself elevated to a consequential position,
felt it incumbent upon his new notoriety to aver that Horton was the
man; compromising with some slight qualms of conscience with the
codicil that "leastways he <i>luks</i> mighty sight like him." That settled
it. And all his wild protestations could not change the decision of the
crowd that immediately transformed the luckless Evangelist from a tramp
into a horse thief.</p>

<p>By this time a man who was duly authorized to act as town marshal
appeared on the scene, and with a deal of importance seized Horton's
person in the majestic name of the Law! and conveyed his seizure,
followed by the crowd, to the village lockup. A small plank box, twelve
feet by twelve feet in all of its dimensions, without a window, and
principally used for the occasional cooling off of some obstreperous
bucolics who on coming to town became surcharged with the staff of life
in a liquid form. Into this hole, standing solitary and alone in the
centre of the village common, he was thrown, and the door closed with
a bang. The rusty key grated in the rusty lock, the rusty crowd outside
gave some rusty whoops and yells, and then went off pawing the air as
men who had done great deeds. It was as though, in some far off Hindoo
village, the tiger that had been fattening his ribs upon the natives
had at last been caught and caged. Everybody, save that poor battered
and bruised form on the floor of the village lockup, was triumphant!</p>

<p>And now of what use is a triumph unless we celebrate it? And what is
the great American method of celebrating triumphs? From the nabob who
in gilded apartments gracefully nods his head to his brother nabob,
as he remarks: "I congratulate you" before sending the soul of sunny
France gurgling down his pink throat, down to the ragged effigy who
leans against the sour-smelling fetid bar and cracks his glass against
the glass of his brother effigy, with: "Here's luck, d—n your soul!"
as he pitches the scorching tanglefoot down his red hot gullet, we
Americans have our own method of celebrating triumphs. We get drunk.</p>

<p>So these Lickskilletonians celebrated in the hour of their triumph.</p>

<p>Stiff, sore, bruised, battered and bleeding, the Evangelist struggled
to his feet and staggering to a narrow, iron-barred slit in the side
of the village lockup, looked out. The sun was creeping to bed among
the purple hills of the horizon. Already it had nearly disappeared;
all save a narrow disk, that with a red, autumnal glow was bidding the
world good-night. Long and earnestly he gazed upon the glowing west,
painted with red and purple and russet, and trimmed with silver and
gold. With its woods and meadows and vales, painted by God's own hand.
With its fading lights, its deepening shadows, its soft grey of coming
twilight. Long he gazed, until the shadows had swallowed up the light,
and the grey of twilight was lost in the dusk of night. Then he flung
himself on the floor, and sleep came with a soft and soothing balm to
anoint his wounds; his eyes filled with that last glow—<i>his last</i>—of
his Creator's sunlight.</p>

<p class="ph2">JUDGE LYNCH HOLDS COURT.</p>


<p>A short distance out of Lickskillet stood a country church. A
quiet-looking, unpretentious frame building, with a stunted little
steeple surmounted by a weather-vane in the shape of an arrow hanging
at right angles on an iron rod with a gilded point. The weekly prayer
meeting was being held that evening, and the yeomen of the vicinity met
to send their appeals for clemency, in a body, to the Great Judge on
high; each taking his turn in the supplications. A sort of prayerful
round-robin. An opportunity to improve the recording angel's record
in the celestial ledger, and enhance their reputations for goodness
among the neighbors by a full, (but inexpensive,) confession of their
sins and wickedness. Confessions on general principles, however—not
specific ones. Brother Longhorn prayed for forgiveness for his sins
in general, but did not mention defrauding Green Southdown in a horse
trade, nor did he speak any thing about restitution. Brother Ploughgit
demanded that the wicked be no longer allowed to flourish like the
green bay tree—and did not tremble with personal apprehension while
doing it. Brother Hedges took much satisfaction in announcing that he
was a poor, weak sinner—which confession was apparently concurred
in by a number of the brethren. Brother Ryefield spoke glowingly of
charity and prayed that they all might be greatly blessed with that
virtue—but said nothing about withdrawing a suit against a man who
was trying to support a wife, five children, and the consumption on
nothing. Brother Powter wanted strength to do His bidding, which
caused Brother Applegate to reflect that if His bidding conflicted
with Brother Powter's <i>own</i> bidding it would take all the strength of
sixteen hundred million yoke of fat cattle to answer Brother Powter's
prayer. Brother Potts was thankful for what he had and wanted more.
Brother Rockafellow prayed that their hearts might all be filled with
an abiding peace and love. And they all say "Amen!"</p>

<p>After meeting the general topic was the capture of the horse thief.
Down in the village the unregenerated were still holding a feeble
celebration, but beyond an excuse for celebrating they did not look
upon the capture as an incentive to sterner action. Not so with the
brethren. They did not endorse the celebration. That is, not publicly.
Moreover they looked upon the celebrants as a vain and worldly people.</p>

<p>But at a cross road Brother Powter met Brother Longhorn, and was
overtaken by Brother Rockafellow and Brother Ploughgit and Brother
Hedges, and several other brothers, and a discussion ensued as to the
safety of live stock in that vicinity—more especially "hosses."</p>

<p>"I tell ye wot," said Brother Powter, "this thing's got to be stopped.
We aint none of us safe!"</p>

<p>"An' I don't see but now's the 'pinted time to stop it," said Brother
Rockafellow.</p>

<p>And Brother Longhorn said:</p>

<p>"Ef we make a example of this one, it'll clear the country of the
scoundrils an' give us peace an' security!"</p>

<p>"But mebbe the lor hed better take its course," suggested a timid
brother.</p>

<p>"Thet's it Brother Calfer; thet's it. Wot is the course of the lor?
Why it's to involve the county hed over ears in debts fur us farmers
to pay, an' let the hoss thief go free! Thet's wot the lor is!" and
this explanation of what the law consisted of met with many approving
expressions of "Thet's so!" "You've hit it!" "Lor's a swindle!" "Ropes
good cheap lor!" and other endorsements.</p>

<p>And the little crowd at the cross roads in caucus assembled appointed
each one present a committee of one to ride around the neighborhood
that night and invite the neighbors to meet before "sun up" on the
public square in Lickskillet, and "devise measures for the protection
of the public peace and property, more especially hosses."</p>

<p>On the cold floor of his prison the Evangelist lay folded in the arms
of the merciful angel of rest. The blood had dried upon his face, and
its deep crimson contrasted weirdly with the ghastly palor of his
countenance even in the faint star light that crept through the one
narrow aperture in the building. His long, thin fingers were clasped as
though in prayer, and ever and anon his lips would move and a smile
break upon them—hideously out of conformity with his blood-stained
face. But blood and wounds and bruises and rags and miseries and
wretchedness, were all forgotten by the sleeper. He was with his
mother. He was with her, in that realm entered only through the portals
of sleep. Again he was a boy. Again with dog-eared books flung over
his shoulder, he sauntered down the green New England lane;—rich in
the glories of wild-roses and gaudy thistle-blossoms; odor-ladened by
groups of cedar bushes and the mellow fragrance of old orchards, tuned
to harmony with the chatter of blue jays and the operatic notes of
bobolinks. Here a pebble to kick, there a mullen head to switch from
its stalk; now a puff-ball to crush with his heel, a rabbit to chase
in the brush, and an old post to lean against with hands in pockets
and books flung at his feet, while he looked and whistled and whistled
and looked, just in sheer glee and relief that the day's work in the
weather-stained schoolhouse was over. Then a shout and a run down
the low hill that ended by the cottage gate, where a thin care-worn
woman, with fond eyes, wrapped him in her arms and pressed her lips
lovingly to his—joyed with him in his joys and sorrowed with him in
his sorrows. No wonder that the lips of him who lay on the hard floor
of the Lickskillet lockup murmured the name of "<i>Mother</i>." The purest,
truest, holiest being that the heart of man ever enshrined for its idol!</p>

<p>But what is this? There is the noise of many voices without—a rush of
many feet. The door of his prison resounds to a heavy blow. The sharp
point of an iron bar is thrust between the jamb and the lock. It
shivers and groans with the pressure. Groans as if in protest against
the violence about to be committed. Then, with a grinding screech, it
flies open and the Evangelist springs to his feet. Springs to his feet
to be confronted by a judge from whose decision there is no appeal.
A judge whose court has flooded this fair land with scenes of blood
and murder. A judge whose jury is the brute passions of mankind. The
abettor of spite, vengeance, ignorance and bigotry. A judge who knows
no law save the law of <i>might</i>. A judge who held his court on the steps
of the guillotine, in the mountain haunts of the Covenanters, and in
the streets of old Venice. A judge, who when banished in loathing
from the old world, brought his dread court to the new, and treads
the civilization, the Christianity and the progress of the nineteenth
century beneath his heel in this fair land. A judge who daily calls
upon us by his acts, cited in the public press, to rise and hurl him
from his bench, and declare ourselves at last on a level with the
enlightened nations of the earth. JUDGE LYNCH!</p>

<p>As Horton arose to his feet he encountered this hideous parody upon
civilization in the shape of two hundred maddened men. Maddened with a
thirst for human life.</p>

<p>"Come out hyar!" yelled the mob.</p>

<p>"Bring him out! Bring him out! Hang the hoss thief! Shoot him! We'll
rid the country of him! Rope him! Rope him!" they cried.</p>

<p>There were many men in the crowd, who in calm reflective moments would
have shrunk from a deed of violence. But they were wild. Wild with
excitement. Wild with the darkness of night. Wild with a self-heated
anger. Wild with the horribly fantastic knowledge that a human life was
in their hands to do just as they pleased with. To crush, to destroy,
to <i>hang</i>—and none to say them nay.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, gentlemen, what will you do with me?" cried the
Evangelist.</p>

<p>"We'll show you! We'll teach you to steal hosses!" they yelled for an
answer.</p>

<p>"I did not steal! As God is my witness I am no thief. Time will prove
it. Will you not give me a chance for my life?" he pleaded wildly.</p>

<p>"Dry up! No use lying now! We know what kind of watches you fellers
trade for hosses!" and a loud laugh greeted this last witticism.</p>

<p>Four men seized the protesting man and running as many ropes about
his neck, they started off dragging him along the road in the clear
starlight, the crowd following hooting and yelling. The ropes tightened
around his throat, and it was with the utmost difficulty he kept
himself from being strangled. Speak he could not, though every atom of
his body was in a dreadful quiver with that appalling sensation which
those who have approached close to a horrible and unexpected death
alone can realize or understand.</p>

<p>Yelling, hooting and jeering, the crowd dragged him out of the village
to the patch of woods near the country church. Every thing was done
hurriedly. A man climbed an oak tree and flung a rope over a sturdy
limb into the hands of those below. At this moment the Evangelist found
tongue.</p>

<p>"Men!" he exclaimed. "Men or brutes! This is murder! <i>Murder!</i> I am as
guiltless of stealing that horse as the child unborn. I have told you
truthfully how I came by it. Will you kill me thus without allowing
me to prove my innocence? <i>Are</i> you men, are you human, are you
Christians? Will you deliberately take my blood upon your hands?"</p>

<p>But a voice replied, and it sounded like that of Brother Rockafellow,
though the man had a handkerchief tied over his face, partly concealing
it:</p>

<p>"Strangier, make yer peace with the Lord. Thar's even marcy fur such as
you, perhaps. Hev ye the rope ready?"</p>

<p>At this moment a new comer appeared on the scene. It was the lank,
thin, care-worn pastor of the little church; the shepherd of this
thirsty flock. The noise had aroused him in his faded cottage, and in
great perturbation and much trembling of his bony limbs, and rubbing of
his withered hands he approached to see what it was all about.</p>

<p>"It's a hoss thief, an' in a minit we're going to hev one less in the
kentry," explained the mob.</p>

<p>Instantly the thin, lank, trembling pastor was transformed into an
iron-nerved, fearless warrior of the Master's army.</p>

<p>"Men," he cried, and his thin voice fairly reached a shriek with the
unaccustomed energy; "men, you shall <i>not</i> kill the man! Vengeance
is <i>mine</i>, saith the Lord! A murderer shall not enter the kingdom of
heaven, and you are committing murder! In the name of Jesus I implore
you to stop. Hold on. Let me alone. Release me. I <i>will</i> get to him.
You are savages. How dare you, sir! Don't kill him. Stop, stop!" and
hustled back by the crowd, this soul, worthier of a nobler tenement,
went down on his knees and begged and prayed that they would hold their
vengeful hands.</p>

<p>"He'll not preach here no more." "We've done with him." "Conference
will hev to give us another preacher." "Make the durned old fool
shet up," and similar hostile expressions were unheard or unheeded.
He reproached, begged, threatened, implored. All was wasted upon the
crowd. The tiger was loose. He had wetted his lips in imagination,
was he to be cheated of his prey? The good man's protestations and
supplications were alike disregarded.</p>

<p>"At least let me pray with him. Let me give him the consolation of our
blessed Lord and Saviour in these, his last moments upon earth," he
implored.</p>

<p>This request was at first refused, but ultimately reluctantly granted,
with the observation that they could not see what the old idiot wanted
to make so much fuss over a durned hoss thief for. The good man shook
Horton by the hand, and spoke consolingly to him, giving him such
sympathy as he could, and begging him to turn his thoughts on Him who
died for all.</p>

<p>A great change had come over the Evangelist. He no longer supplicated
for life, nor indeed did he pay much attention to those around him.
Perhaps he saw how useless it was to search for their feelings.
Perchance his thoughts were far away and death had lost its terrors. To
a question of his only friend he replied:</p>

<p>"No, I have no relatives. There are none that I would care to acquaint
with my fate. But I am an innocent man. Here, standing on the brink
of Eternity, without a hope for this world, about to be ushered, all
unheralded, all unsummoned, into the presence of Him who gave me life,
I would not deceive you. I am innocent. And I solemnly adjure you at
whose hands I perish that in the future, when you have found out the
mistake of your crime, that it shall ever be a warning to you to hold
more sacred that life which God has given, and which, though you may
take, you cannot replace. And may He forgive you as I forgive you."</p>

<p>A man now flung the noose of the rope over his head. Others roughly
ordered the minister out of the way, and the good man affectionately
embracing Horton and bidding him good-bye, retreated to the church
steps, and seating himself, with face upturned and eyes flowing tears,
sang in a thin treble voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Jesus, Saviour of my soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let me to thy bosom fly."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the moment the rope was tightening on the victim's neck, there
occurred a commotion on the outer edge of the crowd, and breathless and
hatless Ben forced his way through and up to the unfortunate companion
of his wanderings.</p>

<p>"Hold!" he cried, "hold! This man is innocent. I was with him when he
traded his watch for that horse. You are murdering an innocent man!"</p>

<p>"Who're you?" roughly enquired a number.</p>

<p>"He's the man who was with me when I got the horse; the man I told you
of. He will prove that I did not steal it," calmly replied Horton.</p>

<p>"That's a likely story!" exclaimed a voice.</p>

<p>"Thief a helpin' thief!" shouted another.</p>

<p>"He's another hoss thief!"</p>

<p>"We've got 'em both! Hang 'em both! Make a clean sweep and clean the
kentry of them!" yelled the crowd.</p>

<p>"I am no thief!" cried Ben. "My name is Benjamin Cleveland. Boston is
my home. I am walking to New Orleans on a wager. You can prove it by
telegraph and hang me if it is not so."</p>

<p>A derisive laugh greeted this information.</p>

<p>"Walkin' to New Orleans, air ye? Well ye'll hev to walk another route,
and a warmer one!"</p>

<p>"Rope him! Rope him! Let's clean the State of the villains, and leave
'em hanging up as a warning!"</p>

<p>As this was shouted Ben felt a rope thrown over his neck, and the next
instant both he and the Evangelist were jerked into the air amid a
chorus of yells. There was a confused murmur of voices beneath him.
He struggled and kicked. Tried to loose the rope that was strangling
him with his hands. The froth oozed from his mouth. The confined blood
seemed bursting his head. Ten thousand bells were clanging in his ears.
He tried to cry out. A low gurgle escaped him. Then all grew black and
blank.</p>

<p>When Ben regained consciousness he was lying at the foot of the oak
tree with a loosened rope around his neck. His head seemed gigantic
in its size and his lips were parched. The grey light of morning was
struggling over the eastern hills. Not a soul was in sight. No,—<i>not a
soul</i>.</p>

<p>But turning his eyes upward they encountered a sight that caused him to
close them again with a groan of horror. For there, swinging gently to
and fro, in the morning breeze, hung the stiff, lifeless body of Horton
the Evangelist. His eyes bulging from their sockets, his swollen tongue
protruding from his mouth, and his gaunt face tinted with the leaden
palor of stagnant blood.</p>

<p>Dead! Hung by the neck. Dead!</p>

<p>As the eye of God came grandly up over the eastern horizon, it glanced
upon awakening nature, and fell upon that hideous, untenanted clod of
abused clay, that gently swung from the sturdy oak. And as it glanced
on the ruin and devastation the little church fell in its way. And it
took the shadow of the steeple along over the road and over the open
space, to the woods, clean to the foot of the oak tree, up which it
pointed like some avenging finger. Up and still up crept the shadow
until it reached the body of the dead man with the weather-vane.
And, Lo! When Ben again dared to lift his eyes, there, on the stark,
still, pulseless breast of the Evangelist, was <span class="allsmcap">THE SHADOW OF THE
CROSS</span>!</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">THE GREAT HARVEST RANGE.</p>


<p>Turn we now to record more grateful scenes. Let us leave the black
cross on the breast of the dead man. The dead man swinging in the
morning breeze. Our backs are turned upon an unknown, moundless grave,
down in a sandy, barren jack-oak field. A shallow grave over which no
head stone tells the passer by that all flesh is grass. A grave on
which the startled rabbit pauses, with ears erect, to heed the breaking
of a twig. A grave on which the quail pipes forth his cheering notes
in the glimmer of the dawn, and the prairie grouse crows good-night to
the setting sun. A grave in which lies mouldering a monument to the
reign of the lawless judge. A grave in which is secreted the prey of
the human tiger. The occupant of the grave has found rest at last. His
tramp is o'er. He sleeps the sleep that knows no waking, he dreams the
dream that knows no breaking.</p>

<p>That there is only one occupant of the shallow grave down in the
black-jack barren is due to the exertions of the man with whom Ben ate
supper the previous evening. He it was who extended aid to our hero
in his dire distress and saved his life. Through his intercessions
Cleveland was lowered from the limb and spared. Like one walking in
his sleep, his mind and energies paralyzed by the dreadful scene
through which he had passed, Ben made a futile attempt to justify
his dead friend's memory. He only met with repulses—nay, threats.
No one would believe him, none give credence to his tale. He found
none who had witnessed the hanging, none who would talk about it,
but plenty who with frowning eyes and threatening looks turned their
backs upon him when he attempted to speak of it. Had Ben appeared
before that bulwark of the law—that greatest of all great American
impositions—the Grand Jury, and told his tale of the <i>crime</i>, the
Grand Jury could not have laid its indicting hand on a single man who
had had any thing to do with the hanging. He did not know this, nor did
he appreciate the people he was among. He called for justice, and came
near getting a flogging. One not unfavorable result was accomplished
by his pertinacious search after justification, however. Though he did
not find the blind goddess, he found a railway ticket that conveyed him
out of the State, and two hundred miles westward. His presence became
disagreeable to the citizens of Lickskillet. The tiger had glutted
himself and was drowsy. He did not like to be disturbed.</p>

<p>A delegation of two benevolent citizens waited upon him and informed
him that from the plentitude of their hearts, and the charitable nature
of their dispositions they were not only willing to condone his recent
acts and view his crimes with a lenient eye, but they would aid him
on his journey, and provide him with a railroad ticket to a distant
point, with the stipulation that his foot should never press their sod
again, and a gentle intimation that his own particular rope would be
carefully preserved for his own particular use. The offer came in the
shape of a command. With a stubbornness, peculiarly his own, Ben would
have rejected it. He would have staid and fought to the death there
and then for his dead friend's memory. But the poor, thin, lank parson
came to him. The good man trembled lest the tiger should be roused from
his slumber. He knew the beast for had he not dwelt beneath the velvet
of its paw for many a day? He demonstrated to our hero the futility
of one man, and he a penniless stranger, attempting the indictment of
an entire community bound together by ties of blood, relationship,
interest and—<i>crime</i>. A community that was a law unto itself. Ben
gathered a clearer view of the case from the good man's explanations.</p>

<p>So Ben was placed on board of a train, and whirled away into Egypt.</p>

<p>Or, to speak more lucidly, into the very centre of Southern Illinois.
And despite the sad incidents that had thronged the past forty-eight
hours of his existence, as he stood on the platform of the station
where the ticket expired and the train deposited him, he made the
reflection:</p>

<p>"Nine days and nine hundred miles from New York! One hundred miles
from St. Louis!" and the nine days seemed nine ages, and the nine
hundred miles seemed so many worlds, separating him from the Benjamin
Cleveland he had parted from and the life he had left, in the far east.
And for the first time since the commencement of his tramp, he felt
alone and lonely.</p>

<p>Tramps! Ben thought he had met many of the brotherhood before, but he
now found himself on their great summer range. The solitary free-rider
or small detachments of two and three, now swelled to squads numbering
so high as a dozen.</p>

<p>In fact he had been dropped by the train on the Great Harvest Route,
extending from the wheat fields of Minnesota, diagonally across the
State of Iowa, crossing the Mississippi at Davenport, and thence
extending clear down into the southern half of Illinois. A strip of
country five hundred miles long, that may appropriately be termed the
Harvest Range. The herd commences to move northward early in July.
Starting in the neighborhood of Du Quoin or Bellville, it follows up
the harvest, heading north-west, and ending the summer's incursion
during the months of September and October in Minnesota. An eastern
person has no conception of the vast army of impecuniosities forming
this great herd of harvest tramps. Forth they come from the purlieus of
cities, from hospitals, work-houses, poor-houses, soup-houses, and the
various charitable asylums that have harbored them during the winter
and spring. Up from the orange-scented south; from the pampas of Texas;
the stave-timber of Arkansas, the cotton-fields of Mississippi; and
from those bon-resorts of the fraternity in the river towns on the
Father of Waters—"Pinch" in Memphis, "Under the Hill" in Natchez,
"Elephant Johnnie's" and "Smoke Town" in New Orleans, and other
celebrated haunts, where an existence (such as it is) has been dragged
through for five months of the year. They crowd the river boats; they
haunt the wood-pile landings, they line the tracks and capture the
trains on their way to the joys and fattenings of the Harvest Range.
Once on the Range and life smiles upon them. Back doors know them so
well that during the favored period, the good housewife responds to
each knock with a chunk of bread in one hand and a hunk of meat in the
other, awaiting no solicitations. And how does the herd graze? They
graze off of the charity of a community mellow with the ripeness of
harvest-time. There help is needed—they are the monarchs of the hour.</p>

<p>They become despotic. They will not solicit work. Work must solicit
them. Their labor is an article in demand, and the price goes up, up,
up. There are special rates paid during harvest—paid at no other
season. In the years immediately succeeding the war harvest hands
received as high as five dollars per day—and were not content. They
never are. If wages are two dollars and fifty cents, they demand three
dollars. If three they ask for four. It is <i>their</i> harvest-time; and
without a cent in their pockets and existing on the bread of charity,
they will hold out for days together, in idleness, rather than work for
less than they demand.</p>

<p>Then a few days work; a glorious spree in which their earnings
disappear; and they move off along the Range. As the harvest retreats
north they follow it. Neither benefitted in purse or person by the
labor they irregularly perform.</p>

<p>The dram shops do a thriving business. Scenes of lawlessness are
numerous, and battles with towns that have tired of their arrogant
idleness and mendicancy frequently occur. Railroads are blockaded
with them. Road employees lead a life of trouble, terror and turmoil.
Incidents have been where they have seized trains. They hesitate at
nothing. Every year the herd becomes larger,—every year its chance
for honest labor smaller and smaller. There is a great enemy eating
up their range; destroying their stamping-grounds. It is <i>invention</i>.
Where seven men held stations and bound in a field, three men on a
<i>harvester</i> now do the same amount of work. What will you do with the
idle four? Where three men labored on a <i>harvester</i>, one now drives and
the <i>automatic binder</i> makes the sheaves. What will you do with the
idle two?</p>

<p>"Make producers of them."</p>

<p>Good. Who will make the consumers, were each to produce for himself?</p>

<p>On to the north—to the great grain fields of Minnesota—go the herd.
And then they come back again; but no longer the solid army that
marched north. Fleeing from the cold they come down in fragments. By
boat, raft, and skiff down the great river. By tramping, and jumping
the trains. By every conceivable method of travelling they make their
way south. Where was this herd twenty-five years ago? We do not know.
Like the Texas cattle trade, it is a growth of the present decade.</p>

<p>It was this Harvest Range that Ben now found himself crossing. The
herd had left. It was far to the north. Remnants of it were numerous,
however. Tramps who had tired of following the trail. Sharp tramps who
cutely remained to fatten on the deserted pastures. Sharper tramps who
sought the lower rendezvous before the herd returned. Crippled members
of the fraternity, left behind. Parties that the law had detained. The
stragglers formed quite a respectable army still.</p>

<p>At least our hero thought so, shortly after ensconcing himself in an
empty box car on a western bound freight, late that night. It was the
only empty and open car in the train, and he was congratulating himself
upon holding exclusive possession of it when a gang of four invaded
his privacy, and in passing the next three stations the excursionists
had augmented to fifteen souls. Of course the train employees became
aware of their presence, and ordered them off twice. The first time
they all got out and going around to the other side all got in again.
On a repetition of the order to dismount they merely laughed and
chaffed the conductor. The conductor telegraphed the state of affairs
to Maidensville and called for help to eject them. The operator made
the dispatch public, and the citizens of Maidensville were apprised
of their approaching visitors. The tramps were not blind to these
matters. Expecting a forcible ejectment and arrest when they arrived
at Maidensville, they guarded against it by refusing to allow the
train men to close the doors and lock them in, intending to jump from
the train before it drew up at the station. But the engineer threw
his valves wide open and ran his train into the depot at a rate that
prevented the squad from leaving until it finally stopped. When it
did so a surprise awaited all parties. A delegation of citizens was
on hand with bread and cheese. It begged the tramps to remain in the
car and partake of the food, intimating an immediate arrest for any
who dismounted. They were also informed that their ride to St. Louis
was paid for, and the conductor discovered to his chagrin, that, by
telegraph, the citizens of Maidensville had chartered empty box car
No. 1073 to convey a load of live stock from Maidensville to St.
Louis—that day and date. The conductor opened his eyes. The citizens
smiled broadly. And the fair city of Maidensville was relieved from her
unwelcome guests.</p>

<p>With much hilarity the excursionists completed their ride into East St.
Louis, where they arrived at noon. But what was Ben's dismay to find a
small squad of police ready to receive them as they dismounted! Alas,
here he was again, for the second time during his journey, under arrest!</p>

<p>The crowd was taken before the mayor, arranged in a platoon, charged
with vagrancy, asked no questions, permitted no defence, found
guilty,—and sentenced to sixty days in the work house, and a fine of
fifty dollars, each! Good-bye to New Orleans. Good-bye to the twenty
thousand dollars. Good-bye to the great, glorious, grey eyes. Our
hero was fairly floored. Indignation at this summary treatment was
swallowed up in amazement. Struck dumb with the overwhelming nature
of his disaster, with drooping head and downcast eyes he followed his
companions in misery out of the court room. They traversed several
streets, closely attended by policemen, and at last neared the river.
The tall chimneys and acres of roofs of smoke-curtained St. Louis
arose on the opposite bank. Our friend's heart gave a great leap.
There was the city that had filled his mind these many days. There was
where he was to have again seen <i>her</i>. There was the half-way house of
his tramp. Once in it and his journey would have seemed more like an
accomplished fact, having attained the first objective point in the
stipulations of his wager. And there it was, just across the river—so
near and yet so far! A mile of water, sixty days imprisonment, and
fifty dollars fine, separating them. Wild thoughts entered his head.</p>

<p>He would break from his captors and rushing to the stream plunge in
and swim for the opposite shore. Which, had he done, he might quite
possibly have reached New Orleans, but it would have been in a very
unenviable state. This desperate notion was forming itself into a
determination when his attention was arrested by the voice of the
officer in charge of the squad.</p>

<p>"Men," said that official, "yonder's St. Louis, where you all want to
go. Remember, if you are caught on this side again, up you go for sixty
days. Here are your ferry tickets. Now git!"</p>

<p>It was tit for tat. "Illinois Town" was paying St. Louis in her own
currency. That morning the "Future Great" had shipped, by rail, half
a dozen of her paupers to Chicago. That afternoon the "Future Great"
received a consignment of sixteen tramps from "Illinois Town."</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">OUR HERO REACHES ST. LOUIS.</p>


<p>As Ben placed his foot on the Missouri shore, he cried aloud with an
exultant thrill vibrating every fibre of his body: "St. Louis! Ten days
and ten hundred miles from New York! Hurrah for New Orleans!" and his
emotions were such that he could fairly have turned a double somersault
and cracked his heels for joy. Then as his feelings quieted down, "Now
for New Orleans," he said. But how? That was the rub.</p>

<p>The levee was lined with steamboats. Boats with wheels behind them
like aquatic wheel-barrows, and boats with wheels at their sides like
folded wings. River crafts piled deck upon deck until the pilot-house,
perched on top of the "Texas" looked like a bird cage. A forest of
black smoke stacks interspersed with golden balls and gilded figures
of eagles, horses, cotton-bales, barrels, and various devices. Some of
the stacks belching forth smoke like the nostrils of a live monster;
others silent and grim. Light draught stern-wheelers in the Big Muddy
trade, that ran way up into the mystic region of the Yellow Stone in
the spring and came down in the fall, taking up with them Indian
annuities and government supplies, and bringing down bullet-holes
in their pilot-houses from the rifles of ungrateful savages who
cannot understand why white men should take their land from them
and pay them in phantom beeves and unkept treaties. Ohio river tow
boats—stern-wheelers also—but aquatic giants. Boats that think
nothing of butting their square heads against four solid acres of coal
flats, twelve feet deep, and shoving the whole field to the lower river
coaling grounds—their very machinery a load sinking them deep in the
water, and well worthy of their names, "Ajax," "Hercules," "Colossal,"
and so on. Raft boats from the St. Croix, Black River and Chippewa,
with their holds stowed full of great coils of rope. Trading boats
from the Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas, White and Red Rivers—boats
that somehow bore about them a romantic aroma of travel and adventure.
Wrecking boats and stump-pullers—that dredge the bottom of the river
from St. Louis to the Gulf. Vast floating palaces in the Memphis,
Vicksburg, and New Orleans trade—their long, fairy-like and gorgeous
cabins elevated on stilts, way high up above the hulls. Boats that
could laugh at sixteen hundred tons of freight, and stow five thousand
bales of cotton! A solid two miles of these crafts, thick as they could
lie, all with their great round blunt noses hanging on the levees.</p>

<p>And then the humanity gathered about them—Diego and African, native
and foreigner—people from all over the world. Acres of cotton-bales,
regiments of hides in bundles, barricades of salt, ramparts of sugar
hogsheads; all being constantly added to by a supply from the bowels of
the monsters on the levee, while down their capacious maws was poured
a stream of flour in barrels, grain in sacks and other productions of
the stomach-supplying north. It was a scene of life and activity, such
as Ben had never before witnessed. A wonderful picture of commerce
proving in stronger tongue than any wordy argument the necessity of an
undivided North and South—a UNION!</p>

<p>Ben gazed and wondered, and wondered and gazed, and the more his eyes
discovered, the more they sought for; while up against the sky loomed
that <i>chef-d'œuvre</i> of modern engineering, the famous bridge. He leaned
against a cotton-bale and gave his eyes a holiday. And well he might,
for the picture has not its equal in all the world.</p>

<p>A light touch on his arm aroused him. He turned and saw—<i>Tommy</i>!
Little Tommy whom he felt he had known for years, instead of days.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! I thought I'd find you on the levee sometime," he exclaimed.
"All the 'bums' sun themselves here!"</p>

<p>Save that he was a trifle thinner and his round cheek had lost some of
its bloom, the boy looked much as he did when Ben parted with him in
Harrisburg. The sparkling brown eyes were the same and the ring of his
voice had lost none of its silver as he danced around Ben crying:</p>

<p>"Bennie, old boy, I'm awful glad to see you! I am indeed. But how thin
you are! Poor Bennie. He'll never make a first-class cadjer, so he
won't. And, my eyes! How ragged and dirty! Why don't you rent yourself
out for a museum of hard times? I hunted, and hunted, and hunted, for
you all along the road, but I must have been ahead of you. I came
through on express trains, I did. Sometimes on the roof, sometimes on
the pilot, sometimes on the platform, and sometimes inside—until I'd
get bounced. I made myself bomb-proof with an old shirt and sixteen
newspapers, and I'm thinking they hurt their boots more than they hurt
me. Laugh again, Bennie. I like to see you laugh—you've got such
pretty teeth. And now you're blushing! Oh, Ben, aint you ashamed!
There's no use, I may as well give you up for a bad job; you will never
be an ornament to the profession; never make a first-class war-horse.
Now tell me all about where you have been, and how you have been,
and—and everything!" and Tommy quite out of words and wind, stopped
exhausted.</p>

<p>Ben was glad to meet a friendly face in the great strange city, and boy
though Tommy was, he felt grateful for his friendship.</p>

<p>"But, Tommy, I have not told you all," said our hero after briefly
relating his experience on the tramp. "Do you know that I have seen you
since you saw me?"</p>

<p>Tommy looked his surprise and answered:</p>

<p>"No! Where?"</p>

<p>"In Pittsburg," and Ben told him how he had stood and listened to the
conversation between Blackoat and Nipper, and how Tommy had appeared
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Had Ben been more attentive or observant of his little friend he would
have noticed that the hand on his arm trembled, and the boy's cheek
paled as he mentioned Blackoat's name. But he did not, and when he
looked up, Tommy's face was a burning red, filled with confusion.</p>

<p>"What a gilly you are, Ben!" he said. "You made a mistake in the dark.
It was some one else you saw and could not have been me, for I didn't
stop in Pittsburg."</p>

<p>Cleveland looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Tommy, are you telling me the truth?"</p>

<p>"Truth positive, Benjamin!" With an endorsing nod of the head. "Don't
you believe me?"</p>

<p>Ben reflected a moment before he answered, and when he did the words
came slow, as though he was trying to persuade himself that he meant
what he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tommy—I believe you. But I was never before so mistaken in my
life. Never in my life."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> a queer delusion," returned Tom; and there the matter dropped.</p>

<p>"And which way now, friend Ben? You have reached your destination, your
pilgrimage is over, there's to be a fatted calf, a purple robe and a
gold ring! Is that the programme?"</p>

<p>"No, not quite," answered Ben, smiling. "The fact is my pilgrimage is
only half over, Tommy. I am going to New Orleans."</p>

<p>"To New Orleans! Why you told me St. Louis!" cried the boy in surprise.</p>

<p>"Very well, and am I not come to St. Louis?"</p>

<p>"Yes, true enough; but you do not remain here?"</p>

<p>"No, my boy. New Orleans is my destination. I have some moneyed
interests there—if I get there in time. If I don't,—well—the
interests are quite as heavy but not of a financial nature."</p>

<p>"All this is a mystery to me, Ben, and I don't ask for your
confidence," said Tommy, shrugging his shoulders; "but when is it
necessary for you to be in New Orleans?"</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock on the morning of the second of next month; just eleven
days from to-day," replied Ben.</p>

<p>"Why you have lots of time! I could go to Mexico by that time," said
Tom encouragingly. "I don't care if I take a trip down the river with
you, Ben. Which way are you going?"</p>

<p>Ben expressed himself pleased at the prospect of his little friend's
company, and thought the river would be their best route.</p>

<p>"So it is, undoubtedly," said Tommy. "You can go from St. Louis to New
Orleans for four dollars on deck. Have you four dollars?"</p>

<p>Ben confessed that he had not. That all his cash assets consisted of
ten cents, the remnant of the twenty-five he had received from the
dray-man in New Jersey City.</p>

<p>"What, you have the dime yet? How saving you are!" cried the other.
"But a dime won't take you to New Orleans. Not by river. Say, you
fellow, how'll a fellow get to New Orleans?"</p>

<p>This last query was propounded to a picturesque representative of the
fraternity who was sunning himself on a neighboring cotton-bale.</p>

<p>"New Orleans? Why buy a railroad and ride down," replied the party
addressed, leisurely turning over on his side, with his face toward our
friend's.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, partner, give us a square answer," expostulated Tommy. "We
want to get down there."</p>

<p>At this the man sat up on the cotton-bale and requested a chew of
tobacco, having obtained which he leisurely continued:</p>

<p>"You can go to New Orleans lots of ways. You can walk down 'long the
levees. Lot's of 'em does that. You can beat your way by boat. Lots
of 'em does <i>that</i>. You can go from here to Cairo by boat or rail and
then beat your way from Cairo over the Jackson and Great Northern.
Lot's of 'em do <i>that</i>. That's the way most of the lake men go down
in the fall, and the cotton pickers come up in the spring. The other
big north and south road for the bums is the Texas route. And a very
good road it is. After you get to Poplar Bluffs—that's the end of the
first division—it's clear sailing down to Texarkanna. That's a boss
town too. Stands half in Texas and half in Arkansas. That's where it
got that name. You can shoot a man in Texas and go across the track
and be in Arkansas, or wicey wersey, which makes it very convenient
for the inhabitants. That road runs catacornered across Arkansas, and
its got to be a great cotton route from Texas, which has made it very
convenient for tramps."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all right; but how about the New Orleans route?"
interrupted Tommy, afraid lest the new brother if he continued would
get over into Asia and commence barge-lining the Ganges.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was a saying, you can go from here to Texas, easy as you
please, on the Iron Mountain road. I 'spose four thousand tramps go
down along it every winter and come up every spring. They're the Texas
Rangers of '76—1876!" and he grinned.</p>

<p>"But is it a good route to New Orleans?" asked Ben, who was afraid the
professional was again about to desert his subject.</p>

<p>"No; it's a better route to Texas," replied he.</p>

<p>"But we want to go to New Orleans," protested Cleveland.</p>

<p>"Don't you be a fool and go to New Orleans when you can get to Texas,"
advised their irrelevant informant.</p>

<p>"New Orleans is crowded with tramps every winter. So is all the South,
though they don't howl about the matter the way they do up North. You
let New Orleans alone. You go to Texas and be a Ranger!"</p>

<p>"A Ranger? What sort?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"Range all over the country after hand-outs," replied the professional
with another grin.</p>

<p>"You keep telling us about Texas and we are not going to Texas," said
Ben.</p>

<p>"More fool you," placidly commented the Ranger. "Texas is a good state."</p>

<p>Ben was in despair of ever getting information from this source, but
made one last effort to obtain it by asking the garrulous professional
if they could get to New Orleans by the Iron Mountain road.</p>

<p>"Well, you can and you can't," was the highly unsatisfactory answer.
"You can go from here to Little Rock, and can there get off on the
Memphis and Little Rock Road. That road would take you to the river
right opposite Memphis."</p>

<p>"Then it won't take us to New Orleans?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. You'd have to jump a boat from Memphis. But I say! Why in
thunder don't you jump a boat here? That's your best plan. Jump any of
the New Orleans steamers an' keep your eye peeled for the clerk when
he comes around. I see my buddy up the levee. Good-bye. Take the boat.
Better go to Texas though. Might strike a Mexican revolution. Have one
every new moon. Go to Texas. That's my notion," and shouting back these
fragments of advice, the professional withdrew up the levee and was
soon lost in the crowd.</p>

<p>"There Tom," said Ben, "we'll have to go by boat."</p>

<p>"I was aware of that long ago," coolly replied Tommy. "Do you see
that big boat down there with the horns on her jack-staff? That is
the Argenta. She leaves for New Orleans to-morrow afternoon at four
o'clock, and you and I will go on her."</p>

<p>This matter definitely arranged the two friends walked up the levee.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">A SHAVE WHICH HAS A RESULT.</p>


<p>"Tommy, have you seen any one since you came to St. Louis?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Seen any one! Why of course—I've seen thousands," replied the boy
stopping and looking Ben in the face.</p>

<p>"I mean have you seen any one that I know?" explained Ben.</p>

<p>"Any one that you know! That's a singular question. Pray whom do you
know?"</p>

<p>"Come, Tom, you know there is only <i>one</i> we both know. Have you
seen—<i>her</i>?"</p>

<p>"Her?" said Tommy obtusely. "Pray now who's <i>her</i>?"</p>

<p>"Be serious, Tom. There is only one <i>her</i>, and you know the one I mean.
You said I would see them in St. Louis. Are they here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that's</i> it!" cried Tommy petulantly, and a shade of
disappointment crossed his bright face. "You men are such fools! You
never see a pretty face but you must fall in love with it," and then
the boy stopped, and stammered, and blushed, as though in some way he
had committed himself.</p>

<p>But Ben was absorbed in his own thoughts and did not notice his
companion's confusion.</p>

<p>"Never mind my failings, Tom. Perhaps you will have the same when you
get to be a man."</p>

<p>"<i>Mebbe</i>," replied Tommy sententiously.</p>

<p>"Tell me then, is the young lady and her companions here?"</p>

<p>Tommy's looks and manner suddenly underwent a startling change. The
light-hearted cheerful-faced boy was suddenly transformed into a grave,
thoughtful person, and on his countenance was a look of anxiety and
even a shadow of hatred, giving his face an expression that startled
Ben. After a moment's silence, he replied, with his eyes on the ground:</p>

<p>"Yes, they are here. She is here. You wish to see her?"</p>

<p>"I do, I do," exclaimed Cleveland.</p>

<p>"And for what earthly good or purpose?" petulantly asked Tom.</p>

<p>This caused our hero to stop and look troubled.</p>

<p>"True," he muttered, "for what end or for what purpose? Would she look
at me—<i>me</i> a <i>tramp</i>! Preposterous! And yet I would like to see her,
if only for the pleasure of basking in the glow of those heavenly eyes.
For what good or purpose? Who may tell? I have as much right to win her
as any one. Pshaw! What an idiot am I!"</p>

<p>And yet he was as sensible as the majority of mankind, and had only
been indulging in the pleasant pastime of constructing air-castles.
Without ties of home or kindred to claim his thoughts during the long
days and nights of the tramp, his mind had constantly reverted to this
young woman, and builded in his heart a creation that had at last taken
full occupancy of it. No wonder then when his daydreams were about to
be brought face to face with reality the practical common-sense of his
nature had a hard struggle with the fascinations of imagination. Tommy
observed him closely and probably understood what was transpiring in
his mind.</p>

<p>"Ben," he said, "I have heard that all men are fools when in love, and
I think you must be in love. That's no concern of mine however, only
mind you, young man, after you have been well scorched, come to me and
I'll tell you something about love!"</p>

<p>There was such a peculiarly bitter and sarcastic expression in the
boy's tone and face that it recalled Ben's wits from dreamland with a
jump and he devoted his attention to his companion.</p>

<p>"Well, rooster, what is it about love that you profess to know so much?
Are you in love?" he asked with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, but I had a friend once who was," replied the youth.</p>

<p>"And what became of him?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a <i>him</i>, it was a '<i>she</i>'! And this '<i>she</i>' fell in love.
<i>Love!</i> It was something more than <i>love</i>—it was <i>worship</i>! She gave
up home, friends, happiness, <i>salvation</i>—everything did she sacrifice
on the altar of her love—and as a natural consequence she awoke to
find the sacrifice rejected."</p>

<p>"And what became of her?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"She had her revenge! She turned dressmaker and never had her work
done when she promised!" and Tommy gave a whoop and a shrill laugh.
"There my boy," he continued, patronizingly patting Ben on the back,
"you didn't look for that windup, did you? Never mind. When your fair
maid rejects you, you and I'll join hands and tramp all the rest of
our lives together. But I'm a true prophet, Ben; I told you you should
see those people here, and so you shall. And now in return for the
service I am about to render you, you must promise that you will ask no
questions. Do you promise?"</p>

<p>Ben promised most faithfully, and the boy contined:</p>

<p>"You shall see her to-day."</p>

<p>"But what is her name, Tommy?" asked our hero.</p>

<p>"There you go, breaking your promise already. I'll forgive you this
time, only don't do it again. I don't know her name—at least only her
Christian name. That is Bertha. A woman, to-day, gave me a note to
deliver to her. I am to be on Olive Street, between Eighth and Ninth
this afternoon, at five o'clock, and hand it to her as she comes along.
The woman gave me ten cents for doing it. I transfer the duty to you
and we will go and dine off of the ten cents. Come on."</p>

<p>The two friends thereupon dined with the aid of the ten cents. To be
sure it was not an extravagant repast, consisting simply of two great
sheets of ginger-bread, known on the levee as "stage-planks"; but keen
appetites made them palatable, and with plenty of water they possessed
filling properties to a remarkable degree.</p>

<p>Ben then turned up Olive Street alone, and as he walked along the
thronged thoroughfare felt, for the first time during his tramp,
thoroughly ashamed of himself. Could it be that the dirty, ragged,
slouching, unshaved, unkempt reflection he saw in the plate glass
windows, was the Benjamin Cleveland he had known in other days?
Impossible! And yet too true. The effects of his tramp had altered him
wonderfully.</p>

<p>The elements, combined with coal dust and dirt, had bronzed his skin. A
nine days' growth of beard stuck out in prickly profusion on his face.
The hat, that had been shapely in New York, resembled a felt pouch
on which an elephant had stepped. His clothes hung on him strangely.
Altogether he hardly recognized himself.</p>

<p>"And she," thought he, "what will <i>she</i> think? I've ten cents and I'll
have a shave if it sends me into bankruptcy, and look a little more
human."</p>

<p>When he came out of the barber's hands he certainly did look greatly
improved and his clothes seemed to fit him better.</p>

<p>Having reached Ninth Street he stationed himself on a corner and
awaited the owner of the great, glorious grey eyes. He was looking for
two glowing eyes in a head wrapped up in a snowy nubia.</p>

<p>So it is with us all. Our last remembrance holds tenaciously upon
its pictures; and refuses to surrender them to the march of time and
events. After years have changed the faces and scenes we love, we
return to them expecting to find them the same as when we left, and
feel a dull pain when we find that our memories of the past belong to
the past, and are not heirs of the present. So Ben stood, gazing down
the street in search of a white nubia, and was fairly startled into
open-mouthed amazement when a voice nearly opposite to him said:</p>

<p>"Bertha, dear, I am so sorry that you can not remain with us until next
week, if not longer. Must you <i>positively</i> go to-morrow?"</p>

<p>And the person addressed replied:</p>

<p>"I should like to, Mary, but uncle says he positively must go."</p>

<p>The voice of the lady brought Ben's senses back, and there, right
before his eyes, was the object of his worship—more lovely, more
beautiful, he thought, than he had ever pictured her.</p>

<p>Bertha certainly was gifted with good looks far more generously than
her sisters. To be sure she no longer wore a billowy mass of white
worsted about her head, that Ben's picture was familiar with, but in
its place was a saucy little hat that turned up behind, and an ostrich
feather that turned up in front; and at the back of the head and under
the cocked-up rim of the hat was a great roll of chestnut hair, with
each particular hair leading from the snowy neck thereto drawn as tight
and as smooth as the top-hamper of a man-of-war. Two pretty shell-like
ears, that this peculiar mode of hair-dressing made stand out from
their owner's head like a pair of little wings, were kept from flying
away by two diminutive soltaire anchors. Under the feather and under
a broad expanse of snowy forehead—roofed over by the architecture
of the saucy hat—beamed forth the eyes that had so effectually
fastened themselves in Ben's soul. They were lustrous grey orbs in
which the sunlight of high noon seemed to have lost itself. Deep and
thoughtful, they were, beaming in purity and confidence; alive with
kind promptings, and singing an undying melody of love and faith. Just
such eyes as we <i>do</i> sometimes see, and ever after remember.</p>

<p>And they lighted up a face worthy to bask in their sunshine. She was
dressed richly, but tastefully, with every external evidence of wealth
and refinement. Poor Ben's heart sank within him. When now brought face
to face with the object of his adoration all his sanguine hopes went
down below zero, and the airy castles of his daydreams crumbled to
dust. How could he aspire to this elegantly attired and lovely formed
mass of femininity! Absurd! He in rags and she in silks! Preposterous!
He an unknown <i>tramp</i>, she a wealthy belle! Outrageous! He hastily
arrived at the conclusion that he was a fool, and immediately called
himself one.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">OFF FOR NEW ORLEANS.</p>


<p>While all this was transpiring, (in Ben's mind) the young ladies had
gathered up their trains in one hand, and with the other extended by
way of a balancing pole—and because the attitude is supposed to be
graceful—were picking their way through the mud of the crossing to the
opposite side of the street. The recollection that he had a letter to
deliver flashed upon our friend's mind, and he hastily followed them.</p>

<p>"Miss, I am commissioned to deliver this to you," he said, politely
lifting the felt pouch from his head.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed to him that she was about to pass on without
taking the missive. Then she appeared to change her mind and asked:</p>

<p>"Who sent it?"</p>

<p>"It is from a lady, a stranger to me," replied Ben.</p>

<p>"Ah, I understand. Thank you," and before Ben knew what had transpired
she had taken the note, and from a dainty pocket-book had placed a
bright half-dollar in his hand.</p>

<p>When he recovered himself both young ladies were half a block away,
and he staring after them stupidly. That was all. She had not only
not recognized him, but scarce observed him at all, and in the little
recognition of himself and services that had been bestowed was an air
of condescension, and haughtiness of high-breeding, that left the
impression in his mind of an utterly impassable gulf between them.
Slowly he turned and walked toward the levee, humbled and mortified,
and with a singular notion forcing itself in upon his humiliation
that his ten cents, expended in a shave, had been money thrown away.
His castles had not only tumbled down, but they had buried him in the
ruins. For several blocks he crushed the half-dollar in his hand, as
though it were the author of his miseries and disappointments. Then, in
a moment of wounded pride and passion, he flung it far into the street,
and felt better.</p>

<p>"What an ass I am," he said bitterly, "to think that she would have
noticed me! Who or what am I that she should grant me the courtesy of
a recognition? I am an <i>ass</i>, that is what I am. And I'll get to New
Orleans as quickly as I can, and if I am successful sail from there to
Europe, and see if I can't pick up some common-sense over there where
all the rest of my countrymen lose what little they have."</p>

<p>"<i>For Memphis, Vicksburg and New Orleans. The swift and palatial</i>
'<span class="smcap">Argenta</span>'; <span class="smcap">Sparbar</span>, <i>Master</i>; <span class="smcap">Quillbucker</span>,
<i>Clerk; will leave St. Louis at 4 P.M., to-day. For freight or passage
apply on board.</i>"</p>

<p>The "Argenta" was the pride of the western waters. She it was that
ran the celebrated race with the "Chief" there several years ago.
Both boats were advertised to go on their usual journey in a quiet,
orderly, non-contesting manner. The captains knew nothing about any
race. The clerks knew nothing about any race. The mates, engineer,
fireman, deck-hands and roustabouts knew nothing about any race. Nobody
knew any thing about any race. So when the boats backed away from
the New Orleans levee out into the broad river there were thousands
of persons there to witness their departure and thousands of dollars
wagered upon them. Both were stripped to the belt.</p>

<p>Everything that would catch wind or water was laid aside. Machinery
carefully looked to, polished and oiled. Superfluous weights removed
and both crafts prepared for the contest that no one knew any thing
about. As a result of all this stripping the Argenta came into St.
Louis ahead of the Chief, and several thousand sanguine individuals
were stripped of their spare change for many months thereafter. It was
the "wind up" of Mississippi yachting. A peaceful epilogue to a long
drama of bursted boilers, murdered men, scalded deck-hands and drowned
passengers. Racing on the western waters is out of date and out of
fashion.</p>

<p>With deep intonings the Argenta's great bell sounded its final notes
of solemn warning. The apple venders and orange peddlers sprang to the
shore. The short-card men, fakirs, and magic-knife and thimble-rig
manipulators deserted their prey. The huge stage was drawn in and
up. The "last man" came rushing down the levee, bag in hand, and was
taken on board on a single plank. There was a great jangling of small
bells—a moment's silence—and then with a rush and a roar, amid the
batter of big paddle-wheels, churning of water, clank of machinery,
pulsations of the great exhausts, and the shouts of the crowd on shore,
the Argenta backed from her berth into the stream, lay a second or two
motionless in the waters, and then turned her nose to the south, and
sped for New Orleans!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">A NIGHT ON DECK.</p>


<p>Ben sat on a barrel, looking about him in wonder. Fifty negro
roustabouts, great sable Hercules they were—scarce half
civilized—secured and arranged the freight and ropes on deck
for their trip, talking the while a mellow-voiced gibberish that
he could but half understand. The mate, as great a savage as the
blacks, though wearing a white skin, and whose reputation was based
upon the fact of his having killed three roustabouts, directed them
something after the fashion of driving cattle. Ben thought he had a
more extensive repertoire of great big round-cornered oaths than any
blasphemy-belching monster he had ever seen or heard tell of. Our
friend wondered the darkies stood the abuse. He thought that being
freemen, brothers and voters they would have taken umbrage at the
aspersions, imprecations and anathemas hurled at them. He found they
rather liked it, and worked to the tune of the mate's profanity much
like a mule team does to the jingling bells above its hames. Previous
to the war a negro was worth more than a white man. Now a white man
is worth just as much as a black. The war elevated the white race.
To understand this matter the reader must know that these roustabout
crews are not always composed of black men. Some steamers carry mixed
crews—that is white and black men working together. Previous to the
war if a mixed crew were "up cottoning" the heavy bales gathered from
along the river and an accident occurred, followed by a splash and
the cry "man overboard!" the captain would anxiously ask, "white or
black?" If the answer was "black" the boat was stopped, life preservers
flung overboard, and every exertion made to save the unfortunate from
a stream that swallows up the strongest swimmer. If "white," however,
the captain looked relieved and sang out to the pilot, "All right! Go
ahead!" That was before the war. <i>Now</i> no questions are asked. It is
"All right, go ahead," any way.</p>

<p>These hard-worked members of the lowest class of labor in the country
(one of the best paid, however) passed and repassed Ben, piling up the
bags of grain, tier upon tier, until they touched the bottom of the
deck above. On the front of the hull, out in the open air, stood the
battery of boilers, reaching back nearly to the wheel-house, the few
feet of intervening space on the guards being occupied on the port
side by the kitchen, and on the larboard by the bakery. The Argenta's
culinary department numbering a little army of thirty persons—cooks,
bakers, assistants and waiters. There were a hundred head of new milch
cows on deck, each side of the battery of boilers, going south where
they would continue to give milk for two or three years, and then dry
up like all cows in the far south. Texas, a state with more cows in it
than all the rest of the Union combined, imports her butter and cheese,
and does without milk. Back, aft of the wheel-houses, on the guards
were a lot of Missouri mules. These with a pet pig that followed the
roustabouts around, a few dogs belonging to passengers, and several
coops full of noisy chickens and geese made the boat appear to Ben
something like Noah's ark. While he was amusing himself in observing
these things, Tommy came to him. With his usual business energy Tommy
had been looking over the vessel, selecting "stowing" places and
informing himself of the clerk's movements.</p>

<p>"We are all safe for below Cairo, any way, Ben," said he. "The clerk
don't come around until after the boat leaves there; he's too busy. We
won't be in Cairo until to-morrow, so we needn't mind keeping out of
the way until then. Let's go back aft and see the fun."</p>

<p>Night had now settled on the waters. Lamps were lit and lanterns hung
about the boat. Back aft a scene that Hogarth's pencil would have
revelled in, met them. Between the mountain load of grain sacks that
occupied the center of the boat and the vessel's stern, was an open
space about thirty feet square. In the center of this stood a long
sheet-iron stove, and around this stove was gathered a motley crowd
of poverty-stricken humanity, roasting potatoes and parching corn,
purloined from the sacks. Care, want, dirt, and misery had established
themselves on their pinched faces, and the one lantern that hung in
the open space giving light to the crowd painted their tatterdemalion
coverings with fantastic effect.</p>

<p>"Those are dead-brokes, every one of 'em," said Tommy, "going to try to
beat the boat down. We will have lots of company."</p>

<p>Too much, entirely too much, thought Ben. He could have spared some
of it. Walking about the narrow limits and seated on bags, boxes, and
the floor, were a lot of migrative birds. Sailors from the Lakes, who,
having spent their summer on the great "unsalted seas," were now going
down to the Gulf to secure berths on "wind-jammers." Laborers, going
south in search of work among the compresses and on the levees. Other
professional knights of the spade and barrow, bound for the fascination
of the "dumps" and the festive "jiggers." There were several of the
gentler sex seated around. Not lone-lorn women, but women in collusion
with members of the sterner sex who were there. Wives, perhaps.
Charitably, perhaps. The yoke of wedlock is not so hard to shift on and
off in a certain class of society as it is in that to which the gentle
reader belongs, perchance.</p>

<p>The lady voyagers were travelling on various businesses. To "keep
shanty" at some levee camp; or pass the winter south with some
friends—not exactly a visit of pleasure either. Rather antiquated
and a trifle worse for wear they were too. But the gentlemen treated
them gallantly. Passed them the circulating bottle with a "Drink
hearty, miss! It's paid for!" and boiled coffee in pots and oyster cans
for them on the stove. Expectorating tobacco-juice and depositing
superanuated quids outside the limits of their immediate vicinity, and,
in fact, "paid them those thousand and one little attentions which
are so grateful to the gentler sex when coming from gentlemen." (The
last expression is in quotations on account of not being altogether
original.)</p>

<p>There was one female present whom there could be no doubts about,
however, even had she not loudly pronounced herself "A high old gal,
you bet!" several times, greatly to the edification of the crowd about
the stove, and the virtuous indignation of the members of her own sex,
who carefully withdrew their skirts from her. This woman, though young
and not ill-looking, was a "gun boat" fragment that had drifted off and
found herself on board the Argenta.</p>

<p>Gun boats? In every large city there is a portion of the town that
visiting officials from other cities are not driven through on
aldermanic rides of courtesy. Perhaps the local dignitaries would think
it derogatory to have a knowledge of them—perhaps they leave their
visitors to hunt up the town for themselves. So have the water-ways
of the west a floating life upon them to which we are not anxious
to introduce the reader on this trip down the river. The young lady
in question circulated among the crowd with a freedom and ease of
deportment that astonished Ben.</p>

<p>"It is terrible," said he to Tommy.</p>

<p>"It's disgusting!" replied Tom.</p>

<p>"And yet how many poor lost ones there are who come down this low,"
continued Cleveland.</p>

<p>And Tommy, growing a little pale, and looking upon the "fragment" with
loathing and pity said quietly: "Yes, man's victim has no half-way
station on the road to wreck and ruin," and the boy walked away, to the
forward part of the boat, where he sat down on a coil of rope and gazed
fixedly at the black river.</p>

<p>There was much drinking and subdued carousing being indulged in. Songs
were sung and jigs were danced, and the crowd seemed determined to
inaugurate their pilgrimage by a general time of festivities. The
center of attraction, however, was a negro, black as black could be,
who was conducting the fascinating game of chuck-a-luck in one corner;
a cadaverous countenanced, thin-lipped, hawk-nosed white man acting
as banker. The chuck-a-luck bank was not a very extensive affair,
consisting simply of an empty cracker box mounted on a grain sack,
with numerals from one to six inscribed upon it with chalk. Behind the
box the black dealer manipulated the dice, and at his side the white
hawk drew in the nickels and small change of those in front. Two short
stumps of tallow candles, permanently located in their own grease,
stood on the box and illuminated proceedings. This scene, peculiar to
the river, was a novel one to Ben. It was full of life and full of vice.</p>

<p>As the night advanced the crowd thinned. Some went to sleep on the
mountain of grain sacks. Others cleaned up a place on the floor and
lay down, while others went forward and crept under the boilers, for
their warmth. Black and white lay down together. Ben still watched
the scene, which though quieted down, was still attractive from its
novelty. The gunboat visitor having satisfied every one that she
was a "High old gal, you bet!" borrowed a nickel from a susceptible
tourist and proceeded to invest in the chuck-a-luck bank. She won,
and greeted her success with a shout of triumph that startled the
sleepers. But luck soon turned against her and she became peevish,
abusive and belligerent; claimed that the black dealer "fingered" his
dice, and suggested the propriety of dispensing with his services and
devoting his body to the flood. She became an annoyance to the game,
and the hawk tried to buy her off with a bribe of two nickels, which
she accepted, but immediately staked them on the ace. The ace lost, and
with a whoop, the damsel sent the box spinning toward the boiler-deck
by a kick, scattering dice, candles, nickels and small change in
all directions. In the crowd of tatterdemalions toasting potatoes,
and parching corn at the stove, were men of action—men who seize
opportunities. The single lantern went out in a twinkle, and in black
darkness, Ben felt a writhing, struggling, kicking mass of humanity
on the floor. Blows, yells, laughter, curses and groans filled the
confined limits of the "deck." A pistol was discharged. Some one cried,
"I'm shot!" And the mate with half a dozen watchmen appeared with
lanterns and clubs upon the scene. With the clubs they untied the human
knot on the floor. The gunboat visitor being dragged from the bottom
of the heap in a sadly demoralized condition, but stoutly clutching
a handful of curly black wool. The tatterdemalions looked still
more tattered, but happy and contented, as though they had enjoyed
themselves. The hawk and the banker arose bankrupt. All struggled
to their feet. No. Not all. One man did not move; not even after the
mate kicked him several times. They then rolled him over and pointed
out the bullet hole in his head. The man was dead. No one knew who
fired the shot, or why. No particular investigation was made. He was
a deck passenger, and what are deck passengers? Human live stock—and
not a very choice breed either. So they rolled the dead man off to
one side and at Cairo he received about fifteen minutes' attention
from a coroner's jury, (who made the discovery that he was killed by
being shot) and about twenty-five minutes from a jobbing undertaker.
The captain of the Argenta paid all expenses rather than have the boat
detained, and who the dead man was or where he lived are secrets buried
with him.</p>

<p>Ben climbed the mountain of grain sacks in company with Tommy, the two
went to sleep immediately under one of the exhaust pipes, where it was
warm and comfortable; for the night air on the river grew quite chilly.</p>

<p class="ph2">BEN WALKS THE PLANK.</p>


<p>Daylight found the Argenta at Cairo, where a few thousand more grain
sacks were taken on board and the dead man disposed of. At Cairo the
vessel also received quite a consignment of tramps, bound South. Tramps
coming in off of the great Harvest Range, and tramps from Chicago and
the cities by the Lakes. It was preposterous to suppose, for a moment,
that the regiment of them now on the steamer could be overlooked by
the clerk, or manage to stow out of sight where he could not find
them. Still they came, thinking that go so little a distance as they
might before being "bounced," it was nevertheless a step in the right
direction.</p>

<p>Scarce had the Argenta left Cairo, and before the new travellers had
time to familiarize themselves with their surroundings, when the clerk
came down on deck and prepared for business. After running everybody
back aft, the deck-hands and roustabouts formed a cordon across the
boat, between the battery of boilers and the pile of grain sacks,
others going to the stern and driving the deck passengers through
a gap in the line where the clerk was ready to receive them. When
the passengers reached this gap the clerk examined their tickets,
or collected the fare where no tickets were produced. When neither
tickets nor money were forthcoming, the impecunious were placed in
a little group by themselves, under the surveillance of some of the
crew. Nothing harsh or unkind was said to them. Indeed their presence
there was expected and looked for. Every trip the boat made there were
delegations of them on board.</p>

<p>At last the inspection ended. The passengers who had proved themselves
all right were allowed to go whithersoever they pleased, and the "bums"
were marshalled in a group up forward around the capstan, strictly
guarded, and the boat's head turned for Columbus, on the Kentucky
shore. Strange to relate, neither of our friends were among either
party—the paid or unpaid.</p>

<p>Tommy, with sleeves rolled up and a gunny sack apron on, was washing
dishes in the cook's galley, in peace, and security, and—soap suds.
How he had accomplished this strategic movement or ingratiated himself
into the esteem of the head cook we do not know—but there the boy was.
Ben, on the other hand, was not so pleasantly located. His person was
concealed beneath a pile of petticoats! The fact was two of the females
in the rear were sitting on our friend's body. During the morning,
Ben had struck up quite a friendship with an honest Celt in patched
corduroys and hickory shirt. In their conversation it was discovered
that the latter had worked an entire summer for Mr. Algernon Smythe,
at his Swiss chatelet, away back on the sunny banks of Long Island
Sound, when that gentleman was first beautifying his grounds. Ben
adroitly mentioned that he knew Mr. Smythe, having worked for that
gentleman, himself. A long overhauling of old times ensued, and a bond
of friendship was established. Our friend informed his new acquaintance
that it was an absolute necessity for him to be in New Orleans on the
second to meet parties with whom he expected steady employment. Having
met with misfortunes he confessed that he was beating his way, for
which his new found friend admired him the more. Now it so happened
that this new acquaintance had established friendly relations with two
of his country-women, deck passengers also. Two sisters they were, on
their way south to meet their husbands, and keep camp for them on the
levee, while the men worked out a sub-contract. These ladies being
introduced to Ben, and hearing his story, and their sympathies being
enlisted—Ben's personal appearance speaking loudly in his favor—they
kindly offered, at the suggestion of their gentleman friend, to sit
upon him during the clerk's raid on deck. And sit upon him they did
with perfect success; not being required to go forward with the other
passengers, but sending their tickets to the clerk by a deputy. So it
happened that when the Argenta ran her great round nose up to the bank
at Columbus, and the gang of captured "bums" were put on shore,—the
gun boat visitor among them, loudly protesting that she was "A high old
gal, you bet!" our friend did not bear them company.</p>

<p>Whether it was the innate modesty peculiar to the sex, or whether it
was that they thought all danger over, we know not. But this we do
know, that Ben becoming somewhat restive under his burden, the younger
of the two remarked to her sister, with a blush and a giggle, that she
thought he might safely be let up. The elder being comfortably seated,
and finding Ben's person a sort of spring cushion was not disposed to
move. But our hero giving another twist to his cramped person caused
the youngest one to bound up with a low cry, followed by another blush,
and Ben emerged to thank the ladies for their kindness. Unhappily,
for him, the mud-clerk at that moment came aft. He had about passed
Ben when some fatality caused him to turn upon Cleveland and ask him
to show his ticket. Ben tried to enter into an explanation; searched
his pockets industriously, and at last, as the clerk became impatient,
appealed to his generosity and philanthropy, requesting to be allowed
to quietly remain and continue his ride. For an answer the clerk hailed
a deck hand and our hero was unceremoniously marched to the bow.
The stage had been taken on board and hoisted, and the Argenta was
withdrawing her nose from the bank when the mate cried to the pilot "Go
slow, a moment!"</p>

<p>"Now, young man, be quick, or you'll go into the river!" This exordium
had reference to a stage-plank, (a plank about eighteen inches wide)
that, at the mate's direction was stuck out from the guards and
weighted on the boat end by four roustabouts—the other end being in
the air. Ben was to run out on this plank and jump on shore. He had
need to be quick, for with the impetus already received the boat was
fast drifting out in the stream and widening the space between herself
and the land. With another sharp order to "Git! and git quick!" he ran
out on the plank.</p>

<p>Whether it happened by accident or from an inherent love of mischief,
hereditary in a direct line from their Darwinian ancestry, we know not,
but just then two of the roustabouts altered and fashioned Ben's entire
life by teetering each other off of the plank just as our friend was
about to spring to the shore from the end of it. The heels of the two
other make-weights went into the air while their heads struck the deck
with a resonant thump. But Ben! He was gurgling and spluttering in the
river, with the stage-plank held in a close embrace.</p>

<p>"Man overboard!" was the cry that brought all of the cabin passengers
who were loitering on their deck near the gangway, to the front; among
them Captain Sparbar. The mate would probably have allowed Ben to get
ashore or go to the bottom, as best he might, but the plank was boat
property and worth saving. That worthy, undoubtedly, viewed it as
unfortunate that in regaining one he was compelled to save the other,
but as Ben hung tenaciously to the plank, both he and it were drawn
on board by means of a rope. And there he stood—as wet as the river
itself—the very picture of misery.</p>

<p>"Throw the hound on shore!" cried the captain, impatient at the delay.
The captain had been both mate and mud-clerk in his day, himself.</p>

<p>"All right, sir!" responded the mate; and then to the man in the
pilot-house: "Hold her nose to the bank a minute, Mr. Hawkins!"</p>

<p>But at this moment a soft female voice was heard saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, captain. See, the poor fellow is nearly drowned. Now as a
favor to me, let him remain."</p>

<p>The captain was about to politely protest, when the sweet voice
silenced him, and the next moment he called to the mate:</p>

<p>"Let the fellow remain, Mr. Blassfeme!"</p>

<p>Then the bells jingled back by the engineers, and the great boat sprang
out into the stream.</p>

<p>Poor Ben, dripping with water, turned his eyes gratefully to the deck
above, and there stood the owner of the great, glorious, grey eyes,
and by her side stood Blackoat, the captain, and a group of admirers.
One glance she gave our hero, and a smile; but the glance bore no
recognition, and the smile was for his comical aspect. They were such
notices as she might have bestowed upon a persecuted animal, rescued
from the hands of its tormentors.</p>

<p>"Shan't I go down and bring your new friend up and give him an
introduction, Bertha? He has been washed now, you know," said Blackoat,
with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Arthur," she replied; "you may thank good fortune that it
was not yourself that needed a good word with Captain Sparbar."</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Bertha?" inquired the captain.</p>

<p>"I think I should have let him go on the bank, sir!" and with a ringing
laugh, in which all joined but Arthur, she disappeared from Ben's
vision.</p>

<p>For a few moments Cleveland stood gazing vacantly at the railing of the
upper deck. He half wished that they had left him in the river. Why, he
could not reason, but he felt that a greater barrier than ever was now
insurmountably raised between the idol of his dreams and himself. Back
he went to the battery of boilers, and with many a joke from the dusky
fireman dried himself quickly in the hot blast from the fire-doors.
This done he sought out Tommy, who having been engaged in scouring
dishes in the cook's galley was unaware of what had transpired in front.</p>

<p>After relating his late adventures he said:</p>

<p>"Tommy, do you know who is on board of the boat?"</p>

<p>"There are a great many people on board of her," cautiously replied
Tommy.</p>

<p>"But do you know of any <i>friends</i> of <i>ours</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, I know of no <i>friends</i> of <i>ours</i>," replied the boy sullenly.</p>

<p>"The man that struck you in the street that evening in New Jersey City
is here," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Well?" answered Tom, not at all surprised at the information.</p>

<p>"And—the young lady who was there with him, is here also."</p>

<p>"Very well. What of it?" asked the lad, vigorously polishing a plate.</p>

<p>"You knew it?" cried Ben in astonishment.</p>

<p>"To be sure," coolly replied Tommy. "That is why <i>I</i> am here."</p>

<p>"Tommy," he continued, after a pause in which he had earnestly examined
the face of his companion; "Tommy, will you answer me a question?"</p>

<p>"That depends on what the question is," cautiously replied the other.
"What is it you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Are you following this party?"</p>

<p>"See here, Ben, the cook lost his wood-sawyer at that last landing. He
was bounced along with the rest of the bums. You are in rare good luck,
and have secured a passage clear through to New Orleans. All you want
is to make yourself solid on the chuck question. Go speak to the cook
right off before any fellow gets ahead of you, and tell him you want to
saw wood for your grub this trip. It's a splendid chance!" and Tommy
shoved Ben toward the galley.</p>

<p>"But Tom, answer my question first; are you following this party?"
persisted our hero, his inquisitiveness proof against the allurements
of the wood-pile.</p>

<p>Tommy was about to leave him, but changed his mind.</p>

<p>"Ben," he said, "if I answer that question, will you promise never to
ask me another concerning them or me so long as we are together?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Never; no matter what happens?"</p>

<p>"I'll ask you no more, Tom, for I know it does not concern me; but tell
me truly, are you following them?"</p>

<p>"<i>To the death!</i>" and the boy's hands clenched and his hazel eyes
glittered as he hissed the words. There was such a concentrated hatred
and bitterness in the utterance that Ben started back and eyed him
aghast.</p>

<p>"There; now you know something that does <i>not</i> concern you. I hope
you are satisfied. Furthermore the meeting in New Jersey City was no
accident. I followed them and ran against that—that man with my hat
down, to learn when and where they were going. Remember your promise,
Ben. Don't trifle with me. Don't break it. For I like you Bennie—I—I
love you. I do indeed, and I don't want to fall out with you." Saying
which, in a voice and manner that had softened to the tenderness of a
girl's, Tom ran into the galley and resumed the polishing of plates.</p>

<p>Puzzled by the mystery surrounding his little friend, Ben still
remembered his suggestion, and on applying to the head cook was duly
installed as Lord of the Buck-Saw to his sable Majesty.</p>

<p>Verily hath his lines fallen in pleasant places. A rescue from the
river, his ride to New Orleans secured, and here, to cap the climax
of his good fortune, here he was living on the fat of the Argenta's
larder, and only exercise enough to give him an appetite. New Orleans
and the twenty thousand dollars appeared already within his grasp.</p>

<p>Two days glided by in peace and plenty. The duties of his new office
were neither irksome nor confining. An hour or so's industrial
manipulation of the buck-saw provided wood enough to last the cook
all day. In return for this service, he was called into the galley
and filled to repletion after the other members of the cook's family
were through. He was the envy of all the "bums" and deck passengers,
passing as a bloated office-holder among them. One serious and matter
of fact "dead broke" to whom Ben surreptitiously carried biscuits from
the galley earnestly advised him not to do too much at a time, but let
each day provide for itself, so that in case the boat blew up or sunk
he would not be a loser. Indeed Ben grafted happy moments on the lives
of many poor devils by secreting victuals about his person while in the
galley and distributing them among the more starved of the free-riders.
There were still a goodly number on board and every raid of the clerk
landed three or four. Where they managed to stow themselves so as to
escape observation was a mystery to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">OUR HERO TAKES A SWIM.</p>


<p>Memphis was passed and numerous points of historical interest. Points
that had dyed the river crimson in the days gone by. But the river
shows no stain—let us sincerely hope the country does not. The
Argenta had passed Napoleon early in the evening. Napoleon is situated
in Arkansas—that is in the aqueous part of that commonwealth—for
Napoleon lies at the bottom of the river. Some years ago the stream
made a highwater dinner off of several plantations and then ate up
Napoleon by way of desert.</p>

<p>It was a lovely starlit night, and the soft, balmy air of the southern
country had a soothing lullaby in it, that entranced our travellers as
they lounged at full length on the guards of the port side. Ben lay
with his elbow on a pile of ropes and his head resting on his hand.
Tommy had nestled close to him and was softly humming a tune, all to
himself. On the deck above was heard the murmur of voices and ripples
of laughter proceeding from the cabin passengers, as they also sat
out enjoying the evening. Suddenly a rich soprano voice broke out in
Foster's lovely melody, "Way down upon the Swannee River," and the
notes went floating over the waters, and way off to the dark line of
timber that skirted the horizon of their vision. In the chorus there
mingled fine tenor and bass voices. Ben lay entranced. He recognized
his infatuation from the first note. He listened for a verse or two and
then unconsciously joined in the refrain himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"All the world is sad and dreary,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Every where I roam;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, darkies, how—"</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The song was never finished. There was a harsh, groaning, crunching
noise; the boat quivered from stem to stern and lurched over like a
drunken man; a crashing of timbers followed; and Ben found himself
hurled far out into the river. Even in his transit through the air he
heard the cries of alarm and shouts of fear that rent the stillness of
the night. Then the great river embraced him, and he commenced battling
for life. Down, down he sank, and when he rose to the surface, his head
struck against a plank and he seized upon it, and found to his joy that
it would just about support his full weight. For an instant the glare
from the open fires of the boilers shot a broad avenue of light over
the waters, and there in the center of the illuminated pathway, there
flashed from darkness into light and from light into darkness again,
the face of Tommy as he clung to one end of a spar while at the other
extremity was Blackoat, his countenance ghastly with a supernatural
terror that something worse than the fear of death had produced.
It was but a moment that they were in view and then the current had
swept them into the gloom. But the light had revealed another form
to Ben. A form that had turned a beseeching face toward him from the
cruel waters, and then sank beneath them. The next instant he felt his
limbs grasped from below, and reaching down a hand to release himself
it became tangled in the meshes of a woman's hair. With an effort he
raised the body, and there in the cold starlight was the countenance of
Bertha facing him! A thrill of joy even in that terrible moment shot
through his frame. He tried to draw her semi-insensible form upon the
plank, but found that it sank beneath their united weights. With an arm
over the plank he slid into the water, and after much exertion managed
to get her upon the preserver he had deserted. It not only bore her
weight, but allowed him to hang upon it with his hands, and partially
kept him up. Ben was a good swimmer and with this support had a chance
for life. But the Argenta, their only hope of rescue, where was she?
Afar off—it appeared to Ben miles away—her cabin lights were seen on
the waters; and another light moving about in her near vicinity that
Ben surmised must be the steamer's yawl boat searching for those thrown
overboard.</p>

<p>Would they find him? Could they hear him? Every moment the distance
between rescue and himself was growing greater and greater. He shouted
with all his strength. Again and again he called for help! Alas! The
river and the night swallowed up his cries. The plank with its precious
freight drifted swiftly away from succor.</p>

<p>The causes leading to Cleveland's shipwreck are briefly told. The
Argenta was hugging a point on the left bank, and just as she had made
it and was about to shoot for the opposite bend, a long, slimy snag
caught in her larboard guard and went crashing through to her "Texas,"
scattering to right and left everything in its course, and throwing
our two friends, and the party of cabin passengers, sitting on the
deck above them, into the river. The headway of the boat tore her
loose from the snag with a loss of guards and decking, but no serious
injury to the craft's hull, and the motion she was under carried her
far out into the stream before the engines could be reversed and her
headway checked. When she at last controlled herself the victims of
the disaster were being rapidly swept away, out of hearing and reach,
by the point current. The steamer's boat picked up one man clinging to
the end of a spar. His face was ashy, his eyes wild, and his mouth set
agape with a speechless terror. When spoken to he did not answer, and
they were compelled to drag him forcibly from the spar into the yawl.
Fright had evidently overthrown reason, and he remained in this dumb
terrified state long after the steamboat was regained.</p>

<p>It was Blackoat.</p>

<p>He was the only one found. The Argenta steamed up and down and across
the river in every direction. But in vain. The flood surrendered no
more, and at last the captain was compelled to relinquish his search
and the vessel's head turned toward its destination.</p>

<p>But how fared our voyagers on the plank? Ben saw the Argenta's lights
grow fainter and fainter with a sickening feeling of despair, and
when at last they faded entirely from view and he was left alone on
the face of the cruel flood his heart sank within him. Like many
another shipwrecked person he might have lost strength when he lost
heart, and quietly surrendered himself to the remorseless waters. He
might have done so, and whispered to himself as he relinquished life:
"It's not worth an exertion," as perhaps men have done before him.
But there on the plank, by which he buoyed himself, lay his whole
world. Life was dearer and sweeter to him at that moment than ever
before. His eyes tried to pierce the gloom that surrounded them and
discover a shore that he might point the plank with its precious burden
toward. But the starlight gave him no aid. All was black and dark. An
impenetrable gloom enshrouded them. He had managed to arrange the young
woman's person on the plank so that it upheld her in safety, and to
make assurance doubly sure he took a scarf that was pinned about her
shoulders and bound her to the board while he trod water.</p>

<p>"Should I get cramped and go under, she may float to some landing," he
thought.</p>

<p>For half an hour this strange voyage continued in silence, the swift
river's current drifting them along at a rapid speed. Then the form on
the plank gave evidence of returning consciousness and Bertha murmured:</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, where am I?"</p>

<p>"There has been an accident. You and I are floating on the river. Be
calm. Cling to the plank. We are all right. We will drift on shore or
be picked up. Be of good heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, will you save me, will you save me? I don't want to drown—I can't
die so! Oh, will you try and save me?" and in her fright she clutched
Ben's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will save you—or die attempting to. Compose yourself,"
replied Ben, earnestly. "There is no immediate danger so long as you
keep the plank. Don't hang on to me so, please, or I will go under."</p>

<p>The girl withdrew her hand and laying her cold wet cheek against his,
he having his chin resting on the plank, she murmured:</p>

<p>"You will save me, I know you will. You are so good. Don't let me
drown, will you?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Ben, stoutly; "you shall not drown. We will drift
somewhere soon where we can be rescued. You shall be saved, fear not.
Have confidence in me, my darling, for I love you!"</p>

<p>"I will, I do. I <i>know</i> that you will save me," she earnestly replied.</p>

<p>On, on drifted this young couple through the darkness. Now she would
pray, long and earnestly, and Ben would say amen. Then she would beg
him not to desert her, and he would valiantly protest that his life was
at her service. Between prayer and supplications they got tolerably
well acquainted. She promised the love and gratitude of a life time,
and he vowed that to save her life at a sacrifice of his own would be
charming.</p>

<p>Though treading on the tail of Death's coat, strange to say, Ben was
happy. He caressed her, as well as circumstances would permit, and
now and then kissed her hand and even her cheek, which she did not
withdraw from him, but would arouse herself and ask: "Are we near the
shore? Do you see the shore yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; not quite. Be of good heart," he would reply.</p>

<p>Then a silence would follow, broken again by her pleadings: "Are we
near the shore? Do you see the shore?"</p>

<p>So several long dreary hours wore by.</p>

<p>"Are we near the shore?" Do you see the shore?"</p>

<p>And Ben's voice grew weaker and weaker, and his answers slower and
slower, when he replied to her supplications:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear; near the shore. Near the shore, I pray God," for there
was a dead faintness and a loss of energy coming over him.</p>

<p>He was growing exhausted and several times his hold upon the plank grew
so heavy that it sank deep in the water; at which Bertha would cry out
that she was drowning and call piteously upon him to save her. Then
mastering himself, for a time our hero would strive to float without
hanging to the board, but each attempt grew shorter than the preceding
one, and he felt himself swiftly drifting into Eternity. Once his hold
on the plank loosened and he began to sink. A spasmodic effort regained
his buoy, but his grasp caused it to sink, and with a shriek the maiden
implored him to save her! Her voice aroused his drooping energies, and
gave him new strength. But presently it faded away, and death closed in
upon him.</p>

<p>"Are we near the shore?"</p>

<p>"I hope so—I pray God so," said Ben in a weak voice. "Will you—will
you kiss me—just once?"</p>

<p>She would have kissed him a thousand times had it been possible.</p>

<p>"Thank you. God bless you, and save and protect you, darling. Cling
tight to the plank. For I feel myself going;—I—I—can't hold
out,—no, not much longer. Don't—let go—good-bye;—I—I always loved
you. Good. Don't let go. Hang tight. Good—What! Thank God! Thank God!
We are saved! Saved! Saved! Bertha we are saved! My feet touch the
bottom! I can <i>walk</i>!"</p>

<p>It was indeed a joyful fact and one that was much needed at that
identical moment. A few seconds later and Ben would have been too weak
to keep his feet. But now a new life and a new strength was given him.</p>

<p>"Wait; I will see if this is the shore," he said. Then with his face
close to the water he peered around him.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," he presently said. "There is a dark line to the right
and I will make for it. Hold tight to the plank for should I step into
deep water you will need it."</p>

<p>Slowly pushing the plank in front of him he made his way toward the
dark line he had taken for the shore. For several minutes he cautiously
waded through the flood, and the water fell from his chin to his breast
and from his breast to his thighs and then he could see land ahead of
him with bushes on it. At this happy discovery he set up a great cry
of joy, and unlashing Bertha from the plank, took her in his arms
and floundered through the shallow water to the shore. And when they
reached it they both went on their knees, and prayed such a prayer of
thanksgiving, with such heartfelt earnestness, that we are sorry to
reflect that it requires such severe causes to produce such commendable
effects.</p>

<p>Ben arose from his knees first and stood looking upon his beautiful
companion. When she had completed her offering, she arose also,
and taking both of Ben's hands in both of hers, she kissed them
passionately.</p>

<p>"You saved my life," she said, "and I will never, <i>never</i> forget it."</p>

<p>The words were music in his ears, but he modestly protested that the
services he had rendered were his duty, and nothing more.</p>

<p>"No! No!" she exclaimed. "You and I have been too near death's door to
hold any reserve between us. You saved my life, and to my dying day
I will love you for it, and pray to my God that he will reward your
courage and goodness."</p>

<p>Ben actually thought then and there that it was worth a dozen wrecks,
and a score of close calls from the Great Reaper to earn such a reward.</p>

<p>"I was fortunate in having the opportunity to do you a service," he
gallantly replied; "pray do not again mention it. I suppose there are
houses in the vicinity, and if you will wait here I will make a search
for a road."</p>

<p>"No, rather let me go with you. It is so lonely here and I am chilled;"
and the unfortunate young lady's teeth chattered in verification of the
last statement.</p>

<p>In spite of her protests, Ben took off his coat, and wringing the
water out of it as thoroughly as he could, wrapped it around his fair
companion's shoulders. Then confidingly nestling her hand in his the
castaways started on a voyage of discovery.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

</div>

<p class="ph2">THE CASTAWAYS.</p>


<p>Their walk was not a long one. Forcing themselves through a thicket of
young cottonwoods, that scarce reached above Ben's head, a few rods
brought them to water on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"It must be a point," said Ben; "a neck of land jutting out into the
river. Let us follow it up."</p>

<p>So hand in hand, like two full grown babes in the woods, they walked
down the sand that skirted the cottonwood brake. In less than half
a mile they came to the end of the brake, and a rod farther brought
them again to water. Ben stood speechless. Slowly he turned to his
companion, whose wistful, confiding gaze nearly unmanned him.</p>

<p>"Bertha," at last he said, huskily, "we are on an island."</p>

<p>Bertha hid her face in her hands and bowed down in grief at this dire
information.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," said Ben simply and soothingly, and, it must be confessed,
wrapping his arms about her drooping form, and soothing her head on his
bosom as gently as a mother could have caressed it. "Don't cry. The
Hand that brought us here can take us off again. The river has spared
us; fear not but we will get off of the island safely."</p>

<p>And with many gentle endearments and soothing speeches he restored her.</p>

<p>"You are shivering with the cold, Miss Bertha," he said.</p>

<p>"I am cold, very cold, dear friend," she replied; "but so are you.
Think of yourself. Put on your coat again. Morning cannot be far off,
and then the sun will dry and warm us."</p>

<p>But Ben refused the coat, and knew that morning was some hours distant,
and that the coldest portion of the night was yet to come upon them,
before the sun arose and warmed all nature back to life. So he drew
Bertha into the centre of the cottonwood brake, that protected them
from the night breeze now keenly felt sweeping down the river. Then he
prepared a bed out of twigs and leaves, and bidding her lie down he
spread his coat over her and piled leaves and boughs high up around
her. Ere long his labors were rewarded by hearing her draw the deep,
regular breath of slumber. Then he laid down beside her, and exhausted
nature courted sleep, despite the shiverings of his cold wet body.</p>

<p>When our hero awoke the sun was shining down upon him from a cloudless
sky. There were also shining upon him two great, glorious, grey eyes,
as Bertha sat a short distance away, contemplating him sadly. He
noticed with a thrill of pleasure that she had carefully covered him
with the coat, and heaped the twigs and boughs, that had formed her
own bed, about him. The young lady must have been awake some time,
for with the instinct predominant in her sex, she had made some futile
attempts at a toilet. Her dishevelled and sand-ladened hair was coiled
in a mass of not unpleasing snarls, and over it she had tied her
dainty lace handkerchief, having had no hat on her head at the time
of the catastrophe. The drapery of her rich dress was sadly creased
and wrinkled, and she wore all the appearance of a young lady that had
taken an involuntary bath, and then been only partially wrung out. A
memory of the array of good taste, wealth and fashion that passed him
on Olive Street, in St. Louis, flitted through Ben's mind, and in spite
of himself he smiled at the contrast. She evidently understood what was
upper-most in his mind, for returning smile for smile, she said:</p>

<p>"My experience on the river has not been conducive to good appearances.
You must be gentle in your criticisms."</p>

<p>But Ben vowed she never had looked so lovely in all her life. Which,
indeed, she had not; for there was a touching grace in the way she bore
her distress that enhanced the charms of a naturally beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"Your clothes are not dry," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Not quite," she replied, "but I think they soon will be." A look of
misery crossed her face as she said so, however, plainly indicating
that the wet sand-ladened garments she had slept in, and which were now
clinging to her person were anything but congenial to physical comfort.</p>

<p>"Remain here for a few moments while I take a look at our island and
discover some means of escape from it, if possible," said Ben.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to become familiar with the topography of
his new location. It was simply a sand bar half a mile long, and from
four to five rods broad, standing in the middle of an old channel. The
centre of the bar was but two or three feet above the river's surface,
but was already covered with that dense and rapid cottonwood growth
peculiar to the river country of the south. Off to the west, half a
mile away, was another, but a much longer island, also covered with
small trees. On the east a deep, swift channel separated the castaways
from a wide expanse of the everlasting cottonwood brakes that stretched
a mile inland and appeared joined in the back ground to a heavy forest.
To the north and south two points of land, heavily timbered, ran far
out into the river and closed up the horizon.</p>

<p>Ignorant as Ben was of the shifting nature of the Mississippi, he could
easily surmise that in no distant past the river had swept around the
point above him and formed the bay in which his island, and the other
stretches of sand flats, lay.</p>

<p>It was not <i>then</i> a bay, but a bend. Then there had come a change.
Perhaps it was a "wash-out" miles up the river, or a caving of bank
nearer at hand. Or perchance a farmer in scouring his plow ran it
through some narrow neck of sand, miles away, and the river had made
its bed in the furrow, leaving whole townships inland, and putting
other whole townships to soak. Whatever the cause of it, the current
had evidently at a comparatively recent date been shot straight out
from the point, instead of circling around it. The deep bay had filled
with sand and cottonwood timber sprouted upon it. Left to itself a
century and the cottonwoods on the sandbar would have grown to great
trees, and been thrown to earth by the stronger arms and more powerful
growth of oak, ash, and sycamore. Another century and the oak, ash, and
sycamore would have bowed to the woodman's axe. The plow would have
turned up their foothold. Broad acres, rich with cotton and corn, would
have flourished on the captured domain. A "corner" grocery would have
started. Then another, and another, and another. First a hamlet, then
a borough, then a city. Then the iron horse would make his way in the
young metropolis, and it would grow with a wondrous growth. Mayors, and
churches, and rings, and subsidies, and aldermen, and defaulters, and
debts, and boards-of-trade, and societies, and "bosses," and—all the
paraphernalia that goes to make up a great city, would be grown on that
sandbar where Ben stood.</p>

<p>But these things were not to be. There had been another "wash-out,"
another cave-in, or another plow furrow, somewhere else, and the river
was slowly coming back to its first love, and if no "wash-outs" or
furrows intervened the island Ben stood upon would in a few years again
be the river's channel.</p>

<p>Although all of this was not surmised by him he saw enough to fill his
mind with dark forebodings. He knew no boats would come that way, for
even as he looked a steamer's smoke curled over the point of woodland,
miles to the north of him, and disappeared without ever once allowing
him to catch a glimpse of the vessel it issued from. The land side
was evidently as uninhabited as the long island on the west, and both
separated him in their lonely barrenness from succor. Had they then
been rescued from the river only to die a lingering death of starvation
and exposures! Not a match to light a fire with. Not a stranded log to
float from their island prison upon. Their rescuing plank drifted off.
Not strength enough to breast three yards of the swift current that
swept by them. Nothing but to face fate, and—<i>die</i>! The position was
horrible. Had he been by himself he thought he could have borne its
terrors composedly. Nay, he was no coward, and when the worst came to
the worst and he was no longer able to bear the pangs of hunger and the
miseries of loneliness, he could have consigned his body to the river
without a shudder. But to see her, the idol of his existence, the woman
he adored, perish inch by inch, moment by moment, and not be able to
extend a single aid—<i>that</i> made his heart tremble. Slowly and with
down cast eyes he made his way back to where Bertha sat.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, greeting him with a smile, "is this Crusoe land?"</p>

<p>For a moment he thought of hiding the real facts of the case, but on
reflecting that she must shortly discover them herself, he made known
their deplorable position to her. Before the recital was over she was
weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't, please don't, Miss Bertha," said Ben, piteously. "You
quite unman me. It may not be so bad after all. Some boat might come
this way, or we may be able to make our presence known to those who can
rescue us. While there is life there is hope. The Hand that drew us
hither, will not leave us here to perish, be assured."</p>

<p>Bertha arose and placing both hands on his breast looked him mournfully
in the face, as she controlled her feelings, and said:</p>

<p>"I have confidence in Him, my good friend, and if I give way to
weakness you must remember the dreadful trials we have passed through;
nay, that we are <i>now</i> passing through, and that have made me
physically weak, and oh!—" and the lips quivered and the grey eyes
again filled with tears; "I—I feel <i>so wretched</i>!"</p>

<p>Now by all authorities—that is, written authorities,—Benjamin
Cleveland should have drawn himself apart from the innocent being
fate had cast him alone upon this island sand bar with, and been too
high-minded to take advantage of circumstances. He should have occupied
a high moral plane, in which even a platonic passion would have found
no existence, and consoled her with dull platitudes and stilted
phraseology. They all do it that way—in the novels. Alas, Ben did
nothing of the sort. He acted on impulse. He wound his arms about the
fair form and pressed it close to his breast, and as she pillowed her
head on his shoulder he kissed her hair, her forehead, her cheeks times
innumerable. And she liked it; she felt better!!</p>

<p>He said not a word, for he had nothing to say, but he petted her like
a mother would her child, until her drooping spirits revived and
she smiled at his endeavors in her behalf. From his own condition
he readily appreciated the feelings of his companion. There was a
growling, discontented vacuum loud in its demands to be filled; that
sick, weak feeling of hunger that succeeds exertion and exposure. They
were both hungry—very hungry; for hunger makes louder demands at the
commencement of privations than it does after time has allowed the
muscles of the system to contract and close with a tight grip upon
starvation's emptiness. Added to their unappeased appetites, was the
miserable, creeping, disgusting feeling occasioned by wet clothes
filled with irritating sand. These are humble details, we will admit;
but they were the gigantic realities of the moment to the castaways.
Ben realized the facts and actively engaged his mind in search of a
remedy.</p>

<p>"Miss Bertha," he said, "let us at least make ourselves as comfortable
as circumstances will permit. These wet and stiffening clothes, filled
with river sand, are unbearable. Listen to me. I will go to the other
end of the island and wash the sand out of mine, and do you remain here
on the sunny end and do the same. Hang them on the cottonwood bushes
until they are thoroughly dry, and keep yourself in the warm sunshine.
Exercise too—run, jump, or do what you please so as to keep the blood
in circulation; it is positively necessary for us to do all in our
power to court health and comfort, or we will sink down under exposure.
I will not be back for two hours."</p>

<p>In her loneliness she was loth to part with him at all, but he said
reassuringly:</p>

<p>"I will be within hail, and as there is not a living thing on the
island, you need not fear intrusion," and then kissing her tenderly,
(for he had got into that pleasant fashion and his caresses had never
yet so much as brought the faintest blush to her cheek—or his) Ben
walked to the upper end of the sand bar, behind the cottonwoods, and
there disrobed.</p>

<p>While seated on the sand, his wardrobe adorning the neighboring bushes,
he reflected on the gravity of their position.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">CRUSOE LIFE.</p>


<p>As has been stated, the smoke of a steamboat had been seen at the point
above, without the boat coming in view, and during the forenoon another
went by opposite. He could hear the beat of her paddles, and see the
long, thin line of smoke hanging in the heavens over beyond the low
island in the west. But the vessel never came in sight. Evidently the
main current set across from the point to a bend, probably miles away,
in the opposite shore, and boats going down stream took the current,
while those coming up hugged the bend to avoid it. Quite likely the
nearest the passing crafts came to the castaways was the point above,
at least three miles to the north. It was plainly evident that they
could not make their presence known to these.</p>

<p>Once while seated on the sands he thought he heard the faint echo of
hounds, baying in the dark grey timbers that stood bold against the sky
in the east. But what of that? There was a long cottonwood sand flat
between his island's channel and the timbers, and who could tell the
number of other channels and deep lagoons that intervened before the
timbers were reached? The more he reflected upon the matter the more
was he convinced that an escape from the sandbar depended entirely upon
their own exertions, and sincerely regretted that he had allowed the
plank to drift away the previous night.</p>

<p>What was to be done? That was the momentous question; for whatever was
to be done, would have to be done quickly, while strength lasted. All
Ben's latent ingenuity was taxed for relief—stimulated by the cravings
of his empty stomach. At last he struck upon the following plan,—the
only one appearing feasible or practicable. The cottonwood brake that
covered the bar, was of two or three years' growth, with the shoots as
thick as a man's wrist at the butts, and standing seven or eight feet
high. Rather slender poles to use, but with his pocket-knife and the
help of Bertha he hoped to get enough of them together to make a raft
that would bear their united weights. He knew it would take a large
number, but it was their only hope, and they could continue piling tier
upon tier, until they made a serviceable float. When their raft could
bear them, he would await a favorable breeze from the west, and with
a skirt of his coat for a sail, take to the current and try to make
the wooded point four or five miles below. Should they miss a landing,
there was the open river to be gained, and a chance of being picked up
by some boat, while where they were none but Death would come to the
rescue.</p>

<p>The sun had mounted to meridian and was on its way to the western
horizon before Ben's clothes were dry. In the interim he employed
himself in building a hut out of the cottonwoods. With his hands he
scraped a hole a foot deep and four feet square in the sandy soil of
the brake. Around this he propped up a thick wall of the young trees
and covered it with a roof of the same. After placing a heavy carpet of
twigs and leaves on the floor, the hut was comparatively comfortable.
It would give them a shelter during the day and protect them from the
river breeze at night. He now dressed himself, and noticed for the
first time an alteration in his person, a sooner discovery of which
would have afforded him much comfort. His skin had grown red as a
boiled lobster and was painfully sensitive the moment his clothes
touched it. While the sun had been drying his clothes it had been
baking him. Despite the pain he remembered with a pang of remorseful
apprehension the advice he had given Bertha, and was filled with
alarm lest she had literally obeyed him, and was now in a similar
predicament—only worse.</p>

<p>When they met he cautiously advanced the matter by delicately
intimating his own broiled condition, and apologetically inquiring as
to her state. But Bertha only laughed and said, "What an idea!" from
which he inferred that his unfortunate advice had not been religiously
observed.</p>

<p>Then the young couple walked to their new house.</p>

<p>"We will go to housekeeping here," said Ben, pleasantly; and Bertha
blushed, that time.</p>

<p>Both evidently felt much improved in their dry clothes, and though
ravenously hungry, the first pangs of emptiness had modified
themselves.</p>

<p>"We will have to issue cards," continued our hero merrily. "At home,
September 26th, Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Cleveland, <i>nee</i> Bertha——," and
there he suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>"My name is Ford," said Bertha quietly, though not unpleased at her
companion's facetiousness. "Bertha Ford, and I infer from what I have
just heard that I may address you as Mr. Benjamin Cleveland?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, you may not," exclaimed Ben, warmly. "You must call me
'Ben.' I have earned that privilege, have I not?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed I'll call you any thing you wish—<i>dear</i> Ben if you
want me to; for did you not save my life!" and with two soft, white
little hands in his, she looked so winsomely grateful into his face
that Ben blushed in ecstasy,—stammered—and said—he knew not what.</p>

<p>At all events it was arranged that they should call each other by their
Christian names, and this dangerous precedent established, there is
no telling how far circumstances and surroundings might have carried
their intimacy, was it not that on the one side there was the bright
honor of a first and picturesque love, that would no more have allowed
an evil thought to sully it, than it would have permitted an injury to
be done to the object of its adoration; and on the maiden's part were
innocence and purity—needing no bulwarks and for which twin virtues
the conventionalities of society were never builded.</p>

<p>Having examined the hut Ben told her of his plan to escape, and she
flushed with hope and was anxious to commence the work immediately.
So at it the two went. He cut down the young trees and she carried
them in armfuls down to the water's edge, where it was proposed to
build the raft. When night overtook their labors, quite a pile of
the cottonwoods had been accumulated on the strand to reward their
industry. Ben's hands were blistered and Bertha's arms were tired and
sore, but both felt the elasticity of hope. During the early part of
the afternoon's labors much laughter was occasioned at the young lady's
appearance. To see a very pretty young woman with white jewelled hands
and diamond-draped ears packing brushwood through the sand, the long
heavy trail of a rich dress sweeping behind her, was ludicrous. After
sweeping a few furrows, Bertha came after her load without the trail,
and things progressed better. They said but little, and what was said
was only to encourage each other at their labors.</p>

<p>As it grew chilly with the evening breeze sweeping down the river they
retired to the protection of the hut, and there (though it was no doubt
highly indecorous) seated on the carpet of boughs the head of Bertha
found Ben's shoulder and his own stout arms wound about her form.
Ben afterward stated that had it not been for the fact of his being
everlastingly hungry, he would consider it the happiest moment of all
his life.</p>

<p>"Ben!" suddenly said the young lady.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bertha?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Do you know it seems to me as though I had known you for ages, instead
of for only a single day. Is it not strange?"</p>

<p>Now Ben did not think this so very strange. He had no cogitation with
himself about the fellowship of misery, but he did know that during
the entire afternoon when she came up from the strand after her load
of trees and he had freighted her with them, they had looked into one
another's eyes in a confidential manner that had deeply impressed
him. And sometimes when his cuttings had not accumulated fast enough
to furnish a load, she had stood by his side and in a soft, caressing
way had patted his back and shoulders encouragingly, and when he
looked up there was a smile on her lips and a great wide eyed look
of confidence and gratitude beaming down upon him. When their eyes
met they spoke—not in a language of vowel sounds and consonants,
(which same vowels and consonants when they have an opportunity of
materializing rush and tumble over one another, and cram themselves in
where there is no earthly use for them) they spoke not by breath shaped
into philological mysteries, but in the old, old tongue, that has been
spoken since Adam first held converse with Eve, and several years
before that event, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Does it seem strange to you, Bertha? It don't to me. I feel as if I
had known you always—and that I will know you forever!"</p>

<p>Bertha was silent.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me, Bertha—<i>forever</i>!"</p>

<p>"Bertha, <i>I love you</i>! I love you dearly and truly. I love you—!"</p>

<p>Before he could finish Bertha had withdrawn from his arms, and now
sat a little apart, trying to look kindly into his face through the
darkness, and holding both of his hands in hers.</p>

<p>"Ben, <i>dear</i> Ben, don't love me <i>that</i> way," she simply said. "Love me
as a sister. Love me as a very, <i>very</i> dear friend, but do not think
of a nearer or closer relationship, Ben. I know I owe my life to you,
and I would gladly do any thing for you that lay in my power; <i>love
you</i>,—I do, <i>I do</i>! So dearly that I would die for you. But Ben—I can
not marry you. I am to be the wife of another. <i>It is settled!</i>"</p>

<p>There was a sorrowful cadence in the last three words that made Ben
forget his own misery in compassion for his gentle companion.</p>

<p>"<i>Settled</i>, Bertha! Do you <i>love</i> him?" he asked, not just at that
moment reflecting that it was none of his business, and that the
question was an impertinence and an insult.</p>

<p>But instead of answering his question, she said with tears in her voice:</p>

<p>"Listen, my kind, dear friend, while I tell you the little there is to
my life. I was born eighteen years ago. When but little more than four
years old my father died, leaving my mother in straitened circumstances
with two children; myself and a little baby sister. Ben—" and she
softly placed a hand on his arm, "that little sister has never risen
from her bed. She is now fourteen years old, and all those fourteen
years have been spent in patient suffering.</p>

<p>"When I had grown to be quite a girl, a bachelor uncle, my mother's
brother, adopted me, and all the advantages that wealth could offer
I had. Two years ago this uncle died leaving a singular will. His
property, amounting to some three hundred thousand dollars, must remain
undivided, and yet he wished it shared between a nephew and myself. To
accomplish this the will directs that I am to marry my cousin within
two months after attaining the age of eighteen. In case either refuses
to enter into the alliance, the entire estate is to go to the one
agreeing to it—the other to be left unnoticed. Or in case of either
marrying other persons than those specified in the will the property
goes to the one remaining single. Should both marry, the property is to
be divided up among a number of charities. Both my cousin and myself
have employed able legal talent, but they all agree that the will is
drawn up in a manner that absolutely prevents any other disposition of
the property, than those specified. My dear friend, I have a darling
mother who has seen many hardships and trials; one who has loved and
watched over me, and sacrificed and suffered for me as only a mother
can. I have a poor, helpless, little sister—bed-ridden for life. The
income I now receive from my share of my uncle's property provides
them with a comfortable home, and furnishes those necessities, both
little and great, without which life, under the best of circumstances,
is hard. How much more then would it be for a poor helpless little
invalid? Tell me Ben—tell me my good friend—have I a <i>right</i> to
refuse my cousin's proffered hand? Have I a right to take from those
two dear ones the only support they have? <i>Is</i> my life or person my
own? Tell me, you who are so noble and brave; you who would have given
up your life for me—tell me, am I right? For, Ben, I feel that I owe
my life to you, and would now be a corpse at the bottom of the cruel
waters if you had not freely risked your own existence for mine. I
<i>feel</i> this, and feeling it I give myself to you; it is the least
return I can make. You have heard my story; you know my position; would
you have me break my engagement?"</p>

<p>Poor Ben! Alas, poor Ben! Stone by stone the temple had gone up.
Column, and coigne, and architrave; tower, and entablature, and dome.
And here lay the fairy castle—all tumbled at his feet! Built of air,
and into air it had vanished. Bad, black, selfish thoughts strolled
over the ruins. Every one for himself. What should he care for a mother
he had never seen, and a sick sister he did not know? What were their
ease and comfort to him. The girl by his side had confessed that she
loved him. True the confession may have emanated from an overwhelming
sense of gratitude that subverted all other responsibilities. But what
of that? Evidently from the plenitude of her heart and innocence she
felt as she had spoken—that he had saved her life, and that it was
<i>his</i>. Why should he not claim it?</p>

<p>Poor Ben. It was so hard to see his castles tumbled down. So hard to
find his daydreams so near a realization and then to give her up. He
<i>could</i> not, he <i>would</i> not. Not until that moment did he know how
completely this love had taken possession of him. Day by day, hour by
hour, minute by minute, during all the long miles of his tramp it had
been subtly permeating every sense of his body. And must he now pluck
it out? He hid his face in his hands. Then a soft little hand stole
over his head and a warm arm about his neck, while in low accents she
said:</p>

<p>"Tell me Ben, am I right?"</p>

<p>There was good stuff in those hard-headed and stubborn-minded people
who first set Christian foot upon Plymouth Rock. There was good stuff
in this their descendant.</p>

<p>He raised his head and taking both of her hands in his, said
slowly—even solemnly:</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, you are right! But, oh, you do not know how hard it is
to give you up for I love you so much! But you are right, God bless
you, you are right! The service I rendered was one my manhood owed to
humanity—no more. It would ill become that manhood that it claim as a
reward that you desert the paths of duty to those loved ones. Kiss me,
Bertha; you may do <i>that</i>. There now, <i>sister</i>, lie down and sleep, for
I know you need rest," and he covered her with his coat and piled the
leaves and brush about her form.</p>

<p>Then hour after hour Ben sat and held bitter communion with himself.</p>

<p class="ph2">DEATH SHAKES HANDS WITH THE CASTAWAYS.</p>


<p>The castaways arose on the following morning weaker, but refreshed.
Their hunger was not so pressing as upon the previous day, but their
steps were slower, and their vitality had decreased. No reference was
made by either to the conversation of the previous evening. Ben's
face wore a look of great sorrow he could not conceal, and Bertha by
numerous little attentions and pretty little ways, that are the sole
property of her sex, tried to assuage his woes. Alas, the dear girl did
not know that the balm she applied to our friend's wounds made them
grow the deeper and break out afresh.</p>

<p>Cleveland exerted himself among the cottonwoods and Bertha carried
them to the river. During the morning he told her of his own life, and
the nature of the tramp that had led him to his present unfortunate
position. It was then for the first time she knew that Ben was the
boy's champion in Jersey City, and also the stowaway whose passage her
intercessions had secured at Columbus. So little had he occupied her
attention on those occasions that had he not informed her she would
have remained ignorant of the fact that he was Blackoat's antagonist,
or the subject of Mr. Blassfeme's aquatic attentions.</p>

<p>"So then our wreck was not your first acquaintance with the river," she
said, laughing.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "that was my second bath."</p>

<p>Later in the day Ben, after both had been for some time engaged in
silence at work on the raft, asked suddenly:</p>

<p>"Bertha, what is your cousin's name?"</p>

<p>"Arthur Blackoat," she replied.</p>

<p>"Arthur Blackoat!" exclaimed he in a voice of apprehension. "Why—" and
then he stopped.</p>

<p>She waited for him to continue, but he said no more, and both resumed
their work in silence.</p>

<p>By tearing up one of the young lady's skirts into strips and twisting
these, they made cables with which Ben bound the layers of cottonwood
firmly together at the corners, and in the centre. The raft being made
in the style of a "mattrass" such as the celebrated jettie cribs rest
upon at the mouth of the river, and which are to take Nature by the
ears and show the old Dame how she should walk the straight and narrow
path. Before the middle of the afternoon it would uphold Ben, and by
sundown both could safely float upon it.</p>

<p>"We will not start in the dark," said he, "for we need daylight for the
attempt, and a breeze that will give us a chance to reach the point
below. Early in the morning we will give up Crusoe life, and surrender
our domain back to solitude."</p>

<p>Both retired to the hut in high hopes of the morrow's relief, and
ere they slept an earnest prayer of thanks for their safety and
supplications for the success of their efforts was sent to Him who
holds the whole world in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>Then they slept—soundly, if not sweetly—for both were exhausted.</p>

<p>Slept—while the great river went rolling by on its way to the sea.</p>

<p>Slept—while from the north, from the east, from the west, from
thousands of meadow brooks and mountain torrents, from hundreds of
springs and rills, from woodland and from moor, the dragoons of Death
rode out on the flood and bore down upon them!</p>

<p>Ben awoke with a cry of alarm. He was wet through, and the floor of
their hut was flooded! With wild thoughts surging through his brain and
horrible fears palsying his heart, he sprang to his feet and looked
out. And there before his eyes, glistening in the morning sunlight,
lay one vast expanse of water! The island was already submerged by the
flood, <i>and the raft gone</i>!</p>

<p>What words can depict the horrors of that moment! Hope? There was no
hope, nothing but <i>despair</i>! Great, gigantic, crushing despair! Man was
powerless—he could not push back the hand of God!</p>

<p>The fall rains had swollen the northern rivers, and they had discharged
their superabundance into the Mississippi, and that stream was now
rising at the rate of a foot an hour. Already it was over the island
and the cottonwood brake stood in a field of water. Ben would have been
aroused sooner were it not that he had located his hut on a little
knoll in the sand, higher by a foot than its surroundings. Bertha,
reposing upon an elevation of boughs within still slept, but the hungry
river was now licking her garments, impatient for its prey. For an
instant he thought to plunge into the flood and end his miseries at
once and for ever. Then he looked at the sleeping girl and the prayer
sprang to his lips: "Oh God! Take me but spare her!" and kneeling by
her side he gazed so fondly yet so sorrowfully into her face, and
then waked her with a kiss. She looked up with a smile. But the smile
quickly turned to a look of terror, at the words quietly but earnestly
uttered:</p>

<p>"Bertha, we must die. There is no help for us now. The river is rising.
It has covered the island. Our raft is gone. Death will be upon us
soon."</p>

<p>With a wild cry the girl bounded to her feet and rushed from the hut.
The turbid flood stretched all around her, and she stood in water
over her feet. She turned and looked at Ben, so pityingly, as if for
relief. Oh, the helpless agony of that look! He turned away his head
with a groan, and did not dare to look at her again. So he stood, bowed
down by unutterable woe, for some moments; the cruel waters steadily
and stealthily—oh, how stealthily <i>creeping, creeping, creeping</i>,
with a low <i>plash, plash, plash</i>, like the dull senseless whisper of
a devil—rising around him. Then a little hand was placed in his and
an arm laid upon his neck: "Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be
thy name. Thy kingdom come thy will be done—." He raised his head and
looked at her beside him. There was no fear there now, no tremor. The
face upturned to heaven was the face of an angel. "Thy will be done on
earth as it is in Heaven." Then in a clear, silvery voice, that neither
trembled or quavered, the souls of both were confided to the mercy of
Him above, and His protection and care invoked for those who should
remain upon earth. There was no supplication for life, for all hope
now left was a hope for the life immortal. Long did that lovely being
appeal to the Most High, and ere she was through, a strange quiet of
mind and peace of heart had come to Ben.</p>

<p>When the prayer was ended they locked their arms about one another and
stood—waiting for death.</p>

<p>Slowly, but how awfully sure, the waters rose around them. Already the
ripples reached their hands as they stood erect. Soon they would be up
to their breasts. A slight current was already agitating the eddy that
covered the bar, and it caused the tops of the cottonwoods to nod and
bend in the water. A little while longer and the current would become a
torrent, irresistible in its might and fury. Once she looked up in his
face, and said:</p>

<p>"Is it not hard to die, dear friend?"</p>

<p>And Ben answered: "No, perhaps it is best," and he thought death was a
relief. It had lost its terrors and he did not fear it.</p>

<p>"Bertha," he said, "it cannot matter now,—but—it would be a last
earthly happiness to me—tell me, do you love me?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart," she replied.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my darling," he cried.</p>

<p>"God bless us both," she said. "Good-bye," and they kissed one another
a last farewell, forever.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly, oh how terrible and slow, the waters crept, up, up, up!
The current grew in strength. The cottonwoods no longer nodded their
heads, but bent down in the flood. The feet of the castaways refused
their hold upon the crumbling sand. Ben surged with all his strength
against the tide. It was of no avail. Their feet slipped from under
them. The river grasped them. One piercing shriek, one loud cry—and
they were swept away, linked in one another's arms!</p>

<p class="ph2">THE CRUISE OF THE "ROARER."</p>


<p>In Bordeaux a man in cap and blouse rolls great wine pipes from great
warehouses down to great vessels that lie at the quay. These vessels
take the great pipes on board and bear them to the four corners of the
earth.</p>

<p>Away up in the wilds of Arkansas a woodman swings his axe, and the
great oak topples and falls, with a roll of thunder, to the ground.</p>

<p>The man in the blouse on the docks of Bordeaux has never seen, nor
does he know of the existence of the man who swings his axe in the
uninhabited timbers of the White River bottoms. They do not speak the
same language; they do not worship from the same religion; they know
nothing of one another; care nothing. And yet should the woodman stop
swinging his axe the man in the blouse would stop rolling barrels; for
the iron bands that girt the great wine pipes bind together a mutual
interest of these two humble workmen, so many thousand miles apart. And
so the woodman in the forest of Arkansas fells the tall white oak for
the man in the blouse, in Bordeaux. Tell him so and he will laugh at
you. Explain it to him and he will say the reasoning is brought from a
distance. But <i>stop his axe</i>—and the man in Bordeaux will stop rolling
the pipes of wine! For it is the staves from the mighty oak on the
White River bottom lands that hold the wine on the docks of Bordeaux.</p>

<p>The stave-timber of America is being rapidly exhausted. It has been,
and it is a source of much wealth. But a few years ago, Ohio, Indiana
and Michigan produced good staves in large quantities. Now their
production is very limited, and they have none for export. Indeed
they import from other states. A few years ago Northern Michigan sent
staves to Cadiz, Spain; but her timber is rapidly disappearing. The oak
forests of Arkansas and Tennessee are still comparatively fresh, and
supply many staves to Europe. The most available timber is that located
on some of the water-ways traversing the forest, on which they may be
rafted to the Mississippi or put in flat boats at their "banking" and
sent to New Orleans direct. The forest of Eastern Europe, Russia and
Hungary, still furnish some staves; but their trees have been culled
over these centuries past, and the New World must be looked to for a
steady supply.</p>

<p>The "Mary Jane, No. 2" had originally left the Virginia shore, a short
distance below Wheeling, freighted with jugs and crocks.</p>

<p>The "Mary Jane, No. 2" was square in front and square behind, and much
resembled an enormous dry-goods box loaded with pottery. A stovepipe
stuck from her deck, "back aft" when that end was up stream, and "up
for'ard" when she had swapped ends; which she frequently did. An oar
with a blade sixteen feet long and a stem fifty feet, hung over the
end opposite the stovepipe. This was the "gouger." A similar one, but
with a much shorter stem, hung at the stovepipe end, and worked, back
and forth, above that article. That was the "Steer'n o'r." Two short
heavy-stemmed sweeps, with long blades, were hung one on each side.
They were all pivoted on iron pins, and had planks laid on the rounding
roof of the craft for the crew to walk upon as they worked them with
arms extended above their heads. The three last named "oars" were not
difficult for a stout man to handle. But the "gouger," though a child
could lift the stem and dip the blade, would have felled an ox with the
rebound, unless the ox knew how to catch it and hold it up.</p>

<p>Such was the "Mary Jane, No. 2"; looking, on the river, with her long,
leg-like sweeps, not unlike a pre-historic June bug. From Wheeling to
Memphis she supplied the inhabitants with brown receptacles for their
corn juice, and at Memphis her trip ended and she was dismantled. This
last being accomplished by taking the stove out of her "cabin" and
removing the planks of her decking. Then the "Mary Jane, No. 2" lay
peacefully soaking in the waters of Wolf River for many days, until
the acquisitive eyes of Cap'n Willum Smiff, (pronounced with a clear
nose and a mouth unchoked with tobacco-juice, <i>William Smith</i>) fell
upon her. When she engaged the attention of those orbs a change came
over the peaceful life of the "Mary Jane." The name "Mary Jane, No. 2"
passed into history, and the more robust and sounding title of "Roarer"
adorned her stern. With the new nomenclature came a new existence. With
Cap'n Willum Smiff at the "steer'n o'r" and Lieutenant Jeremiah Jarphly
at the "gouger" the "Roarer" sailed for the St. Francis river and was
cordelled a short distance up that stream. There she loaded with pipe
and barrel staves for the man in the blouse on the quay in Bordeaux.
The stovepipe was transferred to the centre of the craft, where it
stuck up belching smoke and fire like a juvenile Popocatapetl. Beneath
the stack was now a dirty little cabin, twelve feet square, with bunks
on three sides, the stove in the centre, and a home-made wooden table
with two similarly constructed stools for furniture. Both cabin and
bunks were formed of tiers of staves. She carried a crew of six men
besides Cap'n Willum Smiff and Lieutenant Jeremiah Jarphly; and the
"Roarer" cast off her lines and set sail for New Orleans.</p>

<p>When Cap'n Willum Smiff appeared "on deck" that morning, after a short
nap on a coil of rope, he said "How'dy" to Lieutenant Jarphly and
gracefully tilted a jug to his lips; the body of the vessel reposing on
his elbow—a feat that Cap'n Smiff was quite proud of. Then Lieutenant
Jarphly tilted it likewise, and as he rubbed his mouth on his shirt
sleeve, said:</p>

<p>"River's risin', Cap'n."</p>

<p>"Yas, by ginger!" replied Cap'n Smiff. "Risin' a boomin', by ginger!
Driftwood comin' down a skallehutin', by ginger! Whar air we, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Wuthin a few miles uv Frenchman's pint," replied his Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Sho as yoh live, by ginger!" said Cap'n Smiff, and then he and
Lieutenant Jarphly took a long and meditative look at the river and
their surroundings.</p>

<p>"Jerry, how much's she riz?" presently asked the commander.</p>

<p>"'Bout five fut, I reckon."</p>

<p>"By ginger!"</p>

<p>Then followed another meditation and contemplation.</p>

<p>"Jerry doh yoh know wot I've a mind toh doh?" asked the Cap'n, and Mr.
Jarphly confessing an ignorance of his intentions Cap'n Smiff continued:</p>

<p>"I've a right smart notion of tryin' Nigger Head chute!"</p>

<p>"No! Go way!" said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Sho as yoh live, I'll be ginger-gingered to ginger ef I aint! See
here, by ginger. Las' time I wus down I noticed a powerful strong
kerrent settin' in 'round Frenchman's pint, inter the old channel.
'Taint morn ten yars ago sense we yosed toh go that channel, Jerry. Hit
wus right arter the spring flood of sixty-six, when the river cut thro'
up at Bordens, thet the kerrent shot off the pint instead of a goin'
around hit, an' left thet great, big san' flat thar, five miles wide.
Now thet she's bruk thro' onto Hempen's Landin' the kerrent's changin'
agin, an' when I kem up on the Bismark frum thet las' trip I was down,
I wus up in the pilot-house 'long with Jeff Neff, an' I pinted it out
to Jeff, an' Jeff sed as how he 'lowed thar'd be the channel agin afore
nex' spring! I've a heap mind toh try it;—by ginger!"</p>

<p>But Lieutenant Jarphly was averse to the experiment. For the reason,
perhaps, that with nautical prescience, he knew that it involved some
extra exertions upon the gouger. The more he objected, however, the
more Cap'n Smiff was determined upon the undertaking.</p>

<p>"By ginger! I'll doh it, I swar I will! See here, Jerry, less see wot
luck's in hit," and he picked up a broad stave, and expectorating a
puddle of tobacco-juice on one side of it, remarked:</p>

<p>"No fur hit, Jerry; chute or no chute—wet or dry? Sing out!" and he
whirled the stave in the air.</p>

<p>"Dry!" cried Jerry.</p>

<p>"Wet she is, by ginger!" said Cap'n Smiff, contemplating his sign
manual, and little dreaming that the lives of two human beings had hung
upon the result.</p>

<p>"<i>Wet</i> she is; and the chute we take. <i>Oars!</i>"</p>

<p>This last brought the crew from their slumbers to the sweeps, and
with steady strokes they commenced propelling the "Roarer" toward the
distant point.</p>

<p>"I want toh hug the pint, near as I kin," explained Cap'n Smiff. "Ef we
stan' toh fur out the kerrent will take us over to the bend, an' we'll
never make the chute."</p>

<p>But the "oars" were well manned and whatever else his ignorance,
Captain Smith was a thorough flat boat's man, and understood the river.
He certainly ought to have been for from boy to man he had devoted
forty years of his life to the study of the science, and all in the
world he had to show for it was the greasy clothes on his back. The
"Roarer" and cargo belonged to a Memphis firm that employed Cap'n Smiff
when he was sober. Still Cap'n Smiff was a happier man, in his way,
than many whose possessions are much more extensive. His wants were
small, and his vices cheap.</p>

<p>As they hugged the point, he called out to Jarphly:</p>

<p>"Give her the gouger, Jerry!" and two of the crew leaving the sweeps,
went to Jerry's assistance, for the gouger was too much for one man.</p>

<p>"Ram hit toh her! Cram hit toh her! Slam hit toh her! Jam hit toh her!"
yelled Cap'n Smiff, who was executing a nervous hornpipe with the
"steer'n o'r" between his legs.</p>

<p>"She takes hit! Now she takes hit! Thar! That'll do," and the great
box swung around the point, and headed for the chute—the first vessel
to cruise the old roadway for ten years! <i>That</i> was the feather Cap'n
Willum Smiff wanted to stick in his nautical cap.</p>

<p>And now that the "Roarer" was headed right, the men bridled their oars
and lounged lazily on the staves.</p>

<p>Suddenly one arose with a shout and cried to his companions:</p>

<p>"What's that? Look there! For God's sake, look! Look!"</p>

<p>"Whar?" asked Cap'n Smiff.</p>

<p>"There! There!" and the man's eyes started as he pointed down the chute.</p>

<p>"Great Jehovah!" cried the captain, "Git in the skiff an' go after
them, quick, quick!" and before his commands could be executed he
himself was seated in the skiff that was being towed along side of the
flat boat, and in another moment was shooting down the stream, the boat
springing like a race horse under the powerful strokes of his oars. And
he was none too quick—none too soon. For as he reached the man and
woman clinging together in the center of a sea of waters, their feet
went from under them, and the next instant, torn asunder, they would
have been beyond the reach of Cap'n Smith's powerful arm. He seized
the woman by the hair and dragged her into the skiff, the man clinging
to the gunwale until she was safely on board, and then crawling over
himself. Both lay in a dead faint on the bottom of the boat, while
Cap'n Smiff, with great beads of cold sweat starting from his forehead
and rolling down over his furrowed countenance, sat with his arms
hanging limp and lifeless by his side, and with eyes blankly staring at
the two forms before him, muttered over and over:</p>

<p>"Great Jehovah! Great Jehovah!"</p>

<p>And let you and I, gentle reader, echo the words, though in a different
humor:</p>

<p>"Great <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>!"</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">BEN LOSES HOPE AND TURNS NAVIGATOR.</p>


<p>When the captain regained the "Roarer" and Bertha and Ben were safely
stowed in the little stave-cabin, with kind faces bending over and kind
hands ministering to them, Cap'n Willum Smiff walked slowly toward
Lieutenant Jeremiah Jarphly and said:</p>

<p>"Jerry, yoh recommember this morn' when we tossed thet thar stave fur
the chute or agin hit?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, Jerry, thet wus a <i>bowed stave</i>, an' I spit on the <i>bowed side</i>
of hit, an' by rights the bowed side oughter hev cum down—but hit
did't, Jerry."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Then Cap'n Smiff looked hard at his Lieutenant, as though he was trying
to shape some unfamiliar thoughts into words.</p>

<p>"No, hit didn't, Jerry. The bent side didn't come down—<i>it come up</i>.
An' it war agin science, Jerry; but hit come up an' we tuk toh the
chute, an'—an' mought hev sumthin'—thar mought somebody—I dunno—I
<i>swar</i> I dunno!" and, as though the unfamiliar thoughts were muddling
his brain, Cap'n Willum Smiff walked back to the stem of the "steer'n
o'r," and slowly straddling it, deluged his surroundings in tobacco
juice, while he lost himself in profound meditation.</p>

<p>There are others than unsophisticated Captain William Smith who have
pondered deeply on the same subject, and been lost at sea far from the
lighthouse of <span class="smcap">Faith</span>.</p>

<p>That evening found the "Roarer" with a line out to a check post on the
levee below the city of Vicksburg. On parting from the crew of the
flatboat Bertha had distributed all she had of value about her person
among them, and bestowed upon Cap'n Smith a glittering diamond cluster
ring from off her hand. Cap'n Willum Smiff at first refused to take
it, but comprehending that he would hurt the young lady's feelings
by refusing longer, he suspended the jewel with a piece of tow about
his neck, and vowed that there it should stay 'till death did them
part. Alas, for the fragile nature of human vows! In less than a week
the diamonds glistened on the person of a New Orleans bar-tender;
hypothecated for drinks; while Cap'n Willum Smiff and Lieutenant
Jarphly were on one of their "Reg'lar Pelican Sprees! A howlin'
Wilderness! You bet!"</p>

<p>After Bertha had been comfortably cared for in bed at the hotel, where
she immediately retired under the direction of a physician, Ben, first
refreshing himself with a good meal, which she insisted upon his
eating, went to the telegraph office and sent the following message to
Mr. Charles Braster of the firm of Braster &amp; Chetwick, Poydras Street,
New Orleans: "Your niece is here safe. Is Mr. Braster in the city?" And
then with a beating heart he awaited a reply. For Ben had formed new
hopes, and thought that perhaps the disaster on the Argenta might after
all have been a stroke of good fortune in his favor. In the course of
half an hour an answer was returned, and as the boy delivered it to
him, he had not the courage to look at it. He unfolded the dispatch,
trembled, then folding it up again without reading, placed it in his
pocket and hastened toward the hotel. Having walked a block he gained
heart, and slowly taking the dispatch from his pocket, unfolded it and
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thank God. Arthur and myself are both here safe. Come down on the
Natchez to-night."</p>

<p class="ph3">(signed) "<span class="smcap">Charles Braster</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>That was all. But it was quite enough. His last hope lay in the dust.
"Arthur and myself are here safe." He read it again as if hoping
against hope. Blackoat was saved! Blackoat was safe and the idol of his
life had passed from his grasp.</p>

<p>He could not meet her again; he dared not. Seating himself in the
office of the hotel he wrote the following note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Bertha</span>:—I wish you joy. <i>Both</i> of your relatives
are safe. Oh, Bertha, I dare not see you again, my darling, my
darling. Pardon my weakness, but if you only knew how sore my heart is
you would pity me. We will probably never meet again. May your life
be one of joy and happiness. You will do <i>your</i> duty nobly—I will,
please God, try to do mine. God bless you, my darling, God bless you.
May your future be as full of sunlight as the labor of my life would
have made it. Again farewell—Heaven bless you.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Ben.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Having dispatched this to Bertha with the telegram he walked out into
the street—again a <i>tramp</i>. And a tramp with a sad, sad heart.</p>

<p>It was the last day of September. He was two hundred miles by land and
twice as many by river from New Orleans, and had but a day more and
a portion of October the 2d to win his wager in. His chances looked
desperate. But he was indifferent whether he won or lost. A dull, dead
apathy to everything had taken possession of him. He felt that it was
a luxury to be a vagabond, an outcast, a tramp, and half inclined not
to go to New Orleans at all, but to start off on a roving career, and
ramble, ramble, ramble, trying to get away from himself.</p>

<p>"Ye're a stout looking lad; can ye handle a barry? If ye can I'm taking
down a gang of fifty min the night to Burk's work on the levee fifteen
mile this side of Baton Rouge, and if yez wants to come along, a dollar
a day and four jiggers is the pay," and the stout florid man who
addressed him asked:</p>

<p>"Will yez go or not? Make yer answer quick, for I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm in for a job, and ready," replied Ben, seizing the
opportunity to leave Vicksburg.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the man. "Go down and get aboord the Roddy for she'll
be laving in an hour. I will see ye on boord and pass yez down."</p>

<p>So on board the Roddy went Ben, and before she started forty more
men engaged for the levee squad had joined him. In ten minutes'
conversation with these he discovered that not one half of them had any
intention of working on the levee. They were simply <i>travelling</i>. Some
were, like himself, on their way to New Orleans. Others were off of
the great Harvest Range, and had already stole their way thus far and
were simply "putting in the winter." That is, drifting from place to
place as sweet fancy directed them. They would stop at the levee camp
and live off of its rations until hunted out, after which they would
take up their line of tramping without an object in view or an ambition
to prompt them. As they went down stream now, so the spring would see
them going up, and the summer months find them scattered through the
northern states. Had one of them been termed a professional tramp or
"dead beat" he would have repelled the insinuation with indignation.
They were after work but never caught up with it. There were some
Americans in the crowd on the boat but the majority were foreigners.</p>

<p>"Why don't you stay and work at the levee?" Ben asked one of them; "you
can earn a dollar a day at it."</p>

<p>"I'm a brick mason," he replied. "I can not do levee work. Neither can
you, as you'll find out if you stop and try it."</p>

<p>"But is there no other work save leveeing in the country?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there's cotton picking. Lots of the bums work all winter
at it. They get from seventy-five cents to a dollar and a quarter a
hundred, and can earn from one to two dollars a day. But the living
is beastly! The southern people <i>mean</i> well enough, but they have no
idea how a laboring man is treated up north, and they use you just the
same as they do the niggers; give you rations—a peck of corn meal,
five pounds of salt pork and a pound of salt a week. You take this and
cook it the best way you can, and sleep in the cotton pen, or any where
you please—that's <i>your</i> lookout. Working for the niggers, a man gets
treated a great deal better than he does working for the white people.
The niggers feed you better and they are surer pay."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Ben; "Do the colored people employ white men?"</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> they? Well I should say. Thousands of 'em every winter. A good
many of the blacks own land and are well fixed, while nearly all of
them that don't own no land of their own, work land on shares."</p>

<p>Ben shortly found a clean spot on the deck and lying down took a much
needed sleep.</p>

<p>It was early morning, and still dark, when they disembarked at the
camp. The men were all up, however, and as he passed through one of the
sheds he had an opportunity for investigating the mysteries of a levee
camp. There was not much to see. A long line of rough board bunks, two
tier high, were ranged on both sides of the shanty, that was supposed
to accommodate four hundred men. That was all. No other furniture, no
other necessaries or comfort. Ben thought it a close approach to a
stable. Which indeed it was, only the animals cared for were human.
While looking about him a bell rang, at sound of which there was a
general cry of "Jiggers! Jiggers!" and a rush by the four hundred for
the outside, where they surged in impatience about a man mounted on a
barrel, who was dealing out whiskey to them in a small tin cup. This
was the "Jigger boss," and four of these cupfuls of the liquor were a
man's daily rations.</p>

<p>After all had received their jiggers, the cry of "grub pile! grub
pile!" was taken up by the crowd, and a rush made for a long line of
tables standing under another shed. These were loaded with tin plates
and pannikins, iron forks and knives, stacks of snowy wheat bread, (for
the levees have as fine bread as there is in the country) juvenile
mountains of smoking "salt-horse," and immense platters of the fruit
known as the "spud laurel," while great pots of a dirty brown liquid,
facetiously termed "coffee" were liberally scattered about. This
constituted breakfast. Our hero ate heartily, aided in his gastronomic
efforts by a number of tallow dips stuck in their own grease along the
tables at intervals, and which were continually being knocked over by
the banqueters as they passed along the food. The repast finished Ben
went with the crowd to the levee, just as it became light enough to see
to work. There he became proprietor of a shovel and wheelbarrow, and
was stationed in a line with twelve others; similar squads occupying
the levee-line for a distance of half a mile. Scarce had he thrown
three shovels full of dirt into his vehicle, when a shrill little voice
piped out, "up all!" and the line began to wheel their barrows up a
steep incline of planks, on to the broad "dump" that constituted the
levee they were building.</p>

<p>"Oye, ye little dyvil, yez is at it airly!" shouted one.</p>

<p>"He haven't a spoonful of dirt in his barry!" said another.</p>

<p>"Be jazez, we'll chuck him into the drink!" said a third.</p>

<p>"And the dyvil fly away wid the bones of the little ferrit!" cried a
fourth.</p>

<p>These remarks were directed at a little withered-up old man who was
"fore-barrow man," or leader of the gang.</p>

<p>"If McCarty don't take that lad and put him to sturring pots in the
soup house, we'll murther him!" exclaimed an exasperated levee builder
in the line.</p>

<p>"Can't he purt a dacent man that'll do a dacent day's wurruk in the
lade, and not be havin' that canary there killin' of the min wid his
'up alls' an' his own barry without the bottom of it covered?"</p>

<p>"Dyvil blow McCarty and dyvil blow little Dinny, but I'll crish the
skull av him in wid a blow of me shovel if he don't be loadin his
barry, and not running the feet off av us!"</p>

<p>The little man treated the remarks with dignified indifference, and
his "up alls" continued to be a theme of hot maledictions. He was a
little used up old levee builder, whose only usefulness now consisted
in his being able to hurry the rest of the gang, as a "fore-barrow"; a
position that no good laborer would have cared to have filled with the
intention of imposing on his co-laborers.</p>

<p>The third time Ben wheeled his "buggy" up the steep incline of planks,
he wheeled it off, and both he and the barrow had a fall of six
feet much to the hilarity of the gang. This happened to him twice in
succession, and as he was ascending the third time off he went, and
toppled the plank over with him, bringing three other barrows and their
navigators to the ground. A loud howl of execrations greeted this
catastrophe. Our hero was called a "watchmaker!" "a flute-player!" "a
dancing-master!" "a mud-clark!" "a 'sodden'!" "To go tip the plank over
on the min!" "Waz it their loif he waz afther!" "Sure it's graves he
should be using his shovel at, and not livyin'!"</p>

<p>The howlings attracted the walking-boss to the spot.</p>

<p>"What the dyvil did yez go for to tip the plank over on the min for?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Ben replied that it was an accident.</p>

<p>"An occident! Howly Mother! An wazn't the plank afoor yer nose? Would
yez want a barn flure to roll the barry on?"</p>

<p>Ben mollified the boss's wrath by telling him of his late shipwreck and
the weakness caused thereby.</p>

<p>"Well, ye poor dyvil, yez doan't want to be stoppin' on the livy.
Every year there do be rigimints of min that's not fit to shovel
sawdust, come tramping along, and aten' the camps up. But you've been
missfourtinate. The best yez'll do for yersel will be to get to New
Orleans and pick up a job yez 'ud be more used to. Go yez now to the
cook's shanty and tell thim to give yez bread and mate; that'll stay by
yez till ye make Baton Rouge, and then yez can get on a boat the night
and be in New Orleans in the mornin'."</p>

<p>Ben thanked the kind hearted boss, and started down the levee with
a big package of bread and "salt-horse" under his arm. He arrived
at Baton Rouge, the former capital of the State of Louisiana, after
dusk, and during the evening, crawled in among the cotton-bales of a
Yazoo River stern-wheel freight-boat. No one was on the lookout for
passengers, as the boat carried none, so he was left undisturbed, and
soon fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>Daylight was beaming upon him when he was awakened by a rough shake.</p>

<p>"Git up boss, git up. We muss have dis yere bale ob cotton!"</p>

<p>He awoke to find the boat stopped, and a gang of black long-shore men
unloading her.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Whare are yere? Why yere at New Orl'ns, ob course!"</p>

<p>New Orleans!</p>

<p>The tramp was done!</p>

<p>The wager won!</p>

<p>New Orleans!</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">NEW ORLEANS, 10 A.M., OCT. 2D.</p>


<p>Our hero could scarcely realize that he was at last in New Orleans.
That New Orleans, so pregnant with his hopes and attainings. New
Orleans, his thought by day and dream by night. New Orleans, the first
accomplishment of his life!</p>

<p>Yet so it was. He was safely landed in New Orleans, and it was the
morning of the second of October!</p>

<p>"What time is it?" he asked, as he sprang on shore.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock," replied a gentleman looking at his watch.</p>

<p>Nine o'clock! And at <i>ten</i> o'clock Smythe would be awaiting his
telegram in New York City!</p>

<p>Twenty thousand dollars, fairly won! And then came a dull, dead pain
that nipped his exultations. What if it were twenty times twenty
thousand dollars? The money could not give him happiness. He had
lost what money could not recover. What was the vile stuff but a
tantalization? An allurement that promised everything and was empty of
fulfillments?</p>

<p>Hold on, friend Ben, don't speak disrespectfully of money. Money is the
lever that moves the world, and love the fulcrum it rests upon. Had you
a fortune would not the lady of your affections be within your reach?
Is she not <i>selling</i> herself to Arthur Blackoat, and would she not much
rather effect the sale with you? The sale is to be a sacrifice, Ben, a
sacrifice—the highest bidder takes her.</p>

<p>Then a great flash of hope illuminated his countenance. She had
confessed she loved him. Aye, had given herself to him, and he had
sacrificed her himself on the altar of Mammon for the good of her
mother and that little bed-ridden sister. But circumstances were
altered. He was now possessed of a small fortune. Twenty thousand
dollars awaited his call in New York City, while four hundred, had,
per agreement, been sent to a correspondent at New Orleans and was now
subject to his order. Twenty thousand four hundred dollars! It was
quite a sum of money. Twenty thousand dollars, judiciously invested,
would afford an income of twelve or fifteen hundred dollars per annum.
Enough for two persons to live quite comfortably on. He would give the
whole of it to Bertha's mother and sister. He would present them with
the twenty thousand dollars, and keeping the four hundred for a start
in life, marry the girl he loved and be happy.</p>

<p>Remember, gentle reader, Ben was young and sanguine, and <i>unmarried</i>.
His mother-in-law, at the time, was in embryo. We older heads look at
these things differently.</p>

<p>What a wonderful change the face of nature wore after these bright
hopes and satisfactory intentions had possession of him. Everything was
light, airy, joyous, happy. He could fairly have shouted aloud in the
fullness of his heart, and offered up many a mental thanksgiving as he
hurried up Canal Street. Had his feelings not been so surcharged with
resurrected hopes he might have noticed that he was on the handsomest
thoroughfare in the world. A street that has not its equal in any
city on the globe. The beauties of architecture that line it are not
prominent (with the exception of one of the most ornate pieces of
iron architecture in America, that stood at the foot of it and in the
very centre of the street. It is now demolished, but a few years ago
was one of the curiosities of the city.) It is not the buildings that
make Canal Street the thing of beauty it is, but it is the great, wide
picturesque street itself, with its tramways and grass-plots and trees
and <i>banquettes</i> in the very centre of it, and its broad roadways on
each side. A noble artery for the great city.</p>

<p>But Ben cared little about streets or cities just then. His mind
and body were alive with new projects for a gladsome future. He
passed a jeweller's and learned the time. It was exactly twenty-five
minutes past nine. The time was exact. Regulated to a second from the
observatory at Washington daily. In five minutes more he had turned
down St. Charles Street and entered the rotunda of the St. Charles
hotel. He quivered with suppressed excitement as he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"New Orleans, Oct. 2d, 9.30 A.M., St. Charles Hotel.</p>

<p>"<i>I am here. Answer immediately.</i></p>

<p class="ph3">"Benjamin Cleveland.</p>

<p>"To Algernon Smythe, Esq., Park Row, New York City."</p>
</div>

<p>When he had handed this to the operator, and seen him tick it off upon
his wonderful little instrument, he felt quieter, and sat down to await
the reply.</p>

<p>We will not attempt to depict Ben's thoughts as he sat there. Suffice
it for us to know that they were one great swell of triumph, and
the pictures of future happiness that floated before his fancy were
gorgeous with crimson and gold. Just as the hands of the clock
announced ten o'clock, the operator called to him, and with the remark
that the matter had been expeditiously attended to, handed him the
following dispatch:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ph3">"Park Row, New York City, }<br>
October 2d, 10.45 A.M. }</p>

<p>"Dear boy, we all sympathize with you. Your dispatch came to hand
fifteen minutes ago. You have lost by thirty minutes. Money has been
paid to Smythe.</p>

<p class="ph3">"John Hough, stake-holder.<br>
"Augustus Wasson, referee."</p>
</div>

<p>Ben read it, and reread it, and read it over and over again. The date
caught his eye, "10.45 A.M." He looked at the clock in the rotunda; it
was but ten o'clock and five minutes then. He called the operator's
attention to it.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; you see the difference between New York and New Orleans time
is sixty-two minutes. When it is nine-thirty <i>here</i>, it is a little
past <i>ten-thirty there</i>. A great many people who don't think of this,
are surprised to receive dispatches ahead of time, as they think. And
it's laughable to see their astonishment sometimes." And the clerk
laughed in verification of it.</p>

<p>But Ben heard him not. His mind was in a whirl. His body trembled. His
legs refused their support and he would have fallen to the floor had
not an attendant caught him.</p>

<p>"You 'pears to be sick, sah. Bettah take some fresh air, sah."</p>

<p>"Lost! Lost! Lost!" he cried. "Everything <span class="smcap">Lost</span>!"</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">THE LITTLE PARTNER.</p>


<p>It was a lovely sunny afternoon, two days after the occurrence narrated
in the preceding chapter. Canal Street was crowded with the wealth and
beauty and fashion of the Crescent City. Fair-haired daughters of the
North swept by in pleasing contrast to the black-eyed beauties of the
far South. Men lounged through the crowd who looked like pictures from
some old canvas; with dark, swarthy, oval faces, and eyes of midnight
darkness. The delicate physique of the octoroon, the creamy tint of a
still lighter-tainted blood, the voluptuous forms of the griff, the
olive-hued creole, and the clear pink and white of the Anglo-Saxon
southron, blended in an ever-moving, ever-shifting panorama of life
that entranced the eye and bewildered the sense of the stranger within
the city's gates.</p>

<p>A tall, square-shouldered, handsome young man floated along in the
living stream. He was dressed in the height of fashion, yet with the
pleasing restrictions of good taste and good sense. He strolled along
with the easy careless step of one accustomed to seeing and being
seen. Many were the admiring flashes dark voluptuous eyes cast upon
him, many the smiles he received. But he paid but little heed to the
homage. His face, though bronzed, was pale, and there was a weary,
restless, unsatisfied look in his eye that illy comported with his
bearing.</p>

<p>It was our friend, Benjamin Cleveland, rehabilitated, revamped,
repolished, reset, rehumanized, and restored to society. So much for
good clothes. Clothes do not make the man, but a man is unmade without
them. They introduce him to society and keep him in it afterward. We
like to rebel against their tyranny, and say contemptuous things about
them, but we fear, honor, and obey them all the same. It is a pity
he could not have clothed that restless, unsatisfied eye. For it but
too plainly indicated that our hero's thoughts were not pleasant or
satisfactory ones. Which indeed they were not, for at that identical
moment Ben was wishing himself at the Hotel de Log, in the old livery
of poverty and trampdom, and the old liberty of vagabondage. He sighed
for the "foot-path." He longed to be a <i>tramp</i> again. His good clothes
felt queer and uncomfortable. They were shackles upon his actions. He
did not possess them, but they possessed him. In his rags he could
have sat on the curbstone and taken a rest, with no one to give him
particular notice. He dared not do it now. As a tatterdemalion he could
have stuck his hands in his pockets, leaned against a lamppost with
crossed legs and enjoyed the scene. Now—he was on exhibition himself.
The first night he attempted to sleep in a bed he laid awake a long
time, and ultimately had to get up and roll himself in a blanket on
the floor, with the washbasin for a pillow, before sleep would come to
him. He had no hopes, no aspirations, no promptings to be or to do.
He seriously thought of resuming tramping as a profession. A panacea
for a mind diseased. A balm for the wounds of his disappointments. A
trunk full of his clothing had been forwarded to New Orleans, and his
wardrobe was satisfactory. He had four hundred dollars in his pocket.
All the money he had in the world. What was he to do? He did not know,
and did not care. He had lost the woman he loved—for whom had he to
labor? Himself? Bah! The "foot-path" was a luxury and a release. He
was half inclined to lock his trunk and send it to some charitable
institution for the benefit of the inmates, go on one tremendous spree
with his four hundred dollars, and when the last cent was used up start
out on the tramp.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were looking out of his eyes he nearly ran against
a ragged boy, who was lounging on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Why, Tommy!" he cried in surprise. "You here in New Orleans!"</p>

<p>But Tommy drew back and looked at him distrustfully.</p>

<p>"Why Tom, don't you know me? Are you going back on an old friend? I am
Ben, your old friend Ben."</p>

<p>"I'll—be—blowed!" and Tommy said no more, but gazed upon him in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Come Tommy, shake hands, little partner."</p>

<p>"Great guns! The prodigal's got home, the calf's been slaughtered,
he's got his ring on, and—Ben <i>is</i> it you?"</p>

<p>"Me for a fact, Tommy. Do I look so much altered?"</p>

<p>"<i>Altered!</i> Why you are a regular <i>swell</i>. Who'd ever think you'd been
a tramp!" and Tommy was again lost in astonishment. Then in the old
familiar tone, he said, seizing Ben's hand and caressing it in his own
peculiar way, "but I'm so glad Bennie, <i>so</i> glad you are in luck. Do
you live here? Do your folks live here?"</p>

<p>"No, Tommy dear, I do not live here nor have I any relatives here—nor
am I in luck. But never mind that, I want you to come with me and get a
new suit of clothes."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind my togs, Ben, these will do very well," and Tommy
blushed, and laughed a little. "This suit I'm used to and it <i>suits</i>
me. I want you to walk over there to a bench in the park, and we will
sit down and have a long chat."</p>

<p>After they had seated themselves the boy said:</p>

<p>"I never expected to see you again, Ben, and I've cried night after
night thinking about you. I thought you were drowned. When we were
thrown into the water I caught hold of a spar, but a piece of timber
struck against it and knocked me off. I got hold of the timber,
however, and was picked up by another boat, an Arkansas River packet,
and brought clear down here. Now tell me how it all happened with you."</p>

<p>Ben related the adventures already known to the reader and moreover
told Tommy of the object of his tramp to New Orleans, and how he had
lost his wager.</p>

<p>"It's all up with me now, Tom," said he sorrowfully. "I have a great
mind to put on the old clothes, and you and I will go tramping again."</p>

<p>"No, no, Bennie, <i>don't</i> do that. Do something noble and worthy of
yourself. You are young, the world is before you; it has honors and
happiness for those who earn them; be true to yourself, Ben, dear.
<i>Don't</i> sink to the horrid level of an outcast, a tramp, when you may
live to honor yourself and do good to your fellowmen."</p>

<p>Ben gazed at him in blank amazement. He could not believe his ears.</p>

<p>"Tommy, what—what in the world's come over you? You speak like—like
the top line of a copy book!"</p>

<p>"Ben," and he gently laid a hand on Ben's arm; "Ben, I speak what I
feel. I like you, Ben—more than you know or understand. I want to
see you worthy of yourself, so that I may be proud of you. And then,
sometime, maybe, when the little tramp comes to you and says: 'Hi,
Bennie, old boy; remember old times?' you'll think kindly of your
little partner—that once was—perhaps, maybe, you'll love him, just a
little bit, for the sake of old times, and—and—"</p>

<p>"Why Tommy, what are you crying about? My dear boy, there's something
wrong with you. Tell me what it is. If money can be of any assistance,
Tom, I've four hundred dollars and you're welcome to the whole of it."</p>

<p>"No, no, Ben," said Tommy, checking his tears, "I do not want money.
I—I want you to like me Ben—to—to—Ben, I haven't any one to <i>love</i>
me!" and the tears came again.</p>

<p>"There, there, my dear boy, don't give way that way. I love you, Tommy,
and I always will. Why little one, I have nobody to love me. I'm alone
in the world myself. And—and—"</p>

<p>"'And' what, Ben?"</p>

<p>"And I always expect to be," he concluded bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you will find some one to love, Benjamin," said the lad more
cheerfully. "Where there's a Jack there's a Jill, you know. And didn't
you improve the chances of your wreck on the sandbar? I thought you
were smitten, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Tommy. Don't speak that way. I love that dear girl more than
words can express. She is an angel, Tom, and—"</p>

<p>"Oh, bah! Angel nothing. She's just a pretty, simpering,
bread-and-butter do-nothing—"</p>

<p>"Tommy, stop! I won't have it. I will not allow you to speak so of that
young lady."</p>

<p>"But I say she is. She's a flirt! She just is and nothing more!"</p>

<p>"Why Thomas, what in the name of Heaven has come over you? You look and
speak so strange. You vilify this young lady whom you do not know, and
whom I so love. You—"</p>

<p>"She ain't worthy of you, Ben, indeed and 'deed she aint," and Tommy's
voice softened and the tears commenced to flow again.</p>

<p>Ben looked at him anxiously. He is sick, he thought. Troubles and
privations and the terrors of the wreck on the river have exhausted and
worried him into illness.</p>

<p>"Poor, little fellow," said he, putting his arm about the boy's body
and drawing him close to him. "You aint well, Tommy, and I know it.
There, there—never mind what you said. I know you meant nothing rude.
You are only mistaken, Tommy. Bertha is one of the noblest girls that
lives. Why do you know she is about to marry a man, whom I know she
despises, so that she can give her widowed mother and poor bed-ridden
little sister a home?"</p>

<p>"No! Is that so?" and Tommy stared incredulously at Ben.</p>

<p>"It is Tommy. She is to marry her cousin to secure a home for her
mother and sister," and Ben related to the boy what Bertha Ford had
told him relative to her uncle's will.</p>

<p>"And <i>he</i>, does <i>he</i> love her?"</p>

<p>"From the conversation we both overheard in Pittsburg I should say not.
I think he only marries her to secure the money."</p>

<p>"Her fate will be <i>terrible</i>," and the boy shuddered.</p>

<p>"Terrible indeed, Tommy. We speak about women <i>selling</i> themselves,
who of us knows the fearful yet noble sacrifices they may be making in
their sale?"</p>

<p>"Good, Ben, good! That shows your heart in the right place, my boy, and
please God it stay there," said Tommy, very earnestly. "But she little
knows the man she is about to marry."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> know him, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Ben," said the boy speaking sharp and quick, "Listen to me before I
change my mind. What you have told me has—has altered some intentions
of my own. You love this girl; does she love you?"</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> she does."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now don't ask me a question; don't say a word to me. There
is to be a wedding to-morrow at St. Martin's Church, Georges Street.
<i>Her</i> wedding. You attend it. <i>Don't fail.</i> You shall have her. <i>I,
Tommy, your little tramp friend, will make her your wife</i>; but—oh,
Bennie, Bennie—" and frantically throwing his arm's around Ben's neck,
he kissed our hero's lips, and breaking from him, rushed away.</p>

<p>Long, Ben sat, lost in astonishment. Stupefied. Then he slowly made his
way back to his hotel.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">IN AT THE DEATH.</p>


<p>St. Martin's Church did not wear a very festival appearance. It looks
more like a funeral than a marriage, that is about to take place, said
Ben to himself, as he quietly entered that edifice on the following
morning and seated himself in the dark corner of a dark pew, where he
could observe what transpired without being himself noticed.</p>

<p>A few idlers, evidently people who seeing a church door open thought it
as good a place to sit down and rest as any that would offer, dropped
in and sat in the rear seats. One had several bundles, evidently a
clerk taking a purchase to the home of a customer who sought the
opportunity to rest his arms and legs among the cushions of St.
Martin's. Some well dressed people, probably strangers in the city, sat
in respectful silence while they examined the edifice with their eyes.
A country couple chatted pleasantly together, and now and then indulged
in a little laugh, followed by a great deal of whispering. Near them a
man sat down with a large paper of peanuts, which he was contentedly
devouring when the sexton politely suggested that he either put them
up or swallow the shells.</p>

<p>It was evidently to be a private affair. The church was dark and
gloomy, and only the shutters of the chancel windows were opened,
throwing a faint, mysterious light upon the long queer-looking line of
empty pews.</p>

<p>Presently the officiating minister entered the chancel from a door in
the rear, clothed in his long white surplice, and sat down while his
eyes investigated the inside of a prayer-book, and kept glancing over
the top of it and down the main aisle as though impatient for their
coming. Then the sound of wheels were heard without, the organ startled
those within by breaking out in a peal of sacred melody, and through
the open doors came the bridal party. Bertha leaned on the arm of her
uncle. She was dressed richly, but quietly, in a travelling suit, as
though the intention was to commence the wedding tour at the chancel
railing. She was very, very pale, and the great, glorious, grey eyes
seemed to cover her whole face, and looked <i>black</i> in their intensity.
But her head was erect and her step firm. She knew what she was doing,
she had counted the cost. She was accepting a lifetime of misery that
she might give a home to those she loved. Ben's breath came short and
thick, and his hands worked nervously as his eyes were fastened upon
her. An elderly lady, the aunt of Miss Ford, was brought in on the arm
of Arthur Blackoat. Blackoat looked triumphant. He was a trifle pale,
and his swarthy countenance in the dim light looked sallow. But his
dark eye flashed out the "success" that was crowning his desires, and
he looked impatient for the ceremony to proceed. A dozen ladies and
gentlemen, friends of the Brasters, had entered the church with them,
and among them Ben was surprised to see none other than Mr. Jonah
Nipper, in company with a very well dressed dignified gentleman of
middle age. These two sat a little apart from the rest.</p>

<p>Presently Bertha Ford and Arthur Blackoat stood at the chancel railing
alone and the beautiful marriage service of the Episcopal Church was
commenced by the officiating clergyman.</p>

<p>Ben could hardly comprehend what was taking place; could hardly realize
that the woman he so adored was being every moment separated farther
and farther from him by a chasm that could never be bridged over for
his hopes to cross on. Then his ears caught the solemn words:</p>

<p>"Into this holy estate these two persons come now to be joined. If any
man can show just cause why they may not be lawfully joined together
let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace."</p>

<p>Cleveland could hardly restrain himself from shouting out:</p>

<p>"I do! The woman loves <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Bah, Ben. Don't make a fool of yourself. <i>That</i> is not a "<i>just cause</i>."</p>

<p>There being no interruption the clergyman continued:</p>

<p>"I require and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day
of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if
either of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined
together in matrimony ye do now confess it. (Blackoat was steadying
himself with one hand on the chancel railing.) For be ye well assured
that if any persons are joined together otherwise than as God's word
doth allow their marriage is not lawful."</p>

<p>Blackoat released the railing and stood erect, but his face was very
pale and his eyes rested steadily on his feet. Turning to him the
minister asked:</p>

<p>"Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy state of matrimony? Wilt thou love
her, comfort her, honor her and keep her in sickness and in health, and
forsaking all others keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall
live?"</p>

<p>And Blackoat answered:</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">You lie!</span>"</p>

<p>The words rang out clear and sharp. They resounded through the edifice.
Echoed along the galleries. Rebounded back from the chancel, and filled
the whole interior with a cold, metallic startling ring. All present
sprang to their feet and looked in amazement down the main aisle.
Blackoat, of all there, did not turn his head. Had he been cast of
bronze he could not have been more motionless, more dead.</p>

<p>"Who interrupts the ceremony?" asked the minister recovering from his
surprise.</p>

<p>"<i>I do!</i>" and a lithe form in male attire bounded up the aisle and
stood in front of the chancel rail. "I do! <span class="smcap">His Lawful Wife!</span>"</p>

<p>It was <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>!</p>

<p>To his dying day Ben will never forget the horror his eyes then saw.
The church had the stillness of death. Not a muscle moved of those
there gathered. Eyes starting from their sockets reached for the mass
at the chancel rail, but motion there was none. All might have been
chiselled out of stone. Pale as death the figure clad in male attire
stood between the woman and man, a hand extended repelling the one, a
hand upraised denouncing the other, two glittering brown eyes fastened
on the man's face. And the man—slowly he turned upon his feet, as
though some mechanism moved an inanimate object. Slowly came he round
and faced the glittering eyes. <i>The eyes of the dead!</i> And as he faced
them the sallow of his countenance turned to the white of clay, his
jaw dropped upon his breast, revealing, in ghastly display, his white
teeth. And up, up, up, from the ground came his eyes, until they rested
on the white face before him. Then in a yell that called a responsive
shriek from all present, <i>he</i> shrieked, "<span class="smcap">God Almighty</span>!" and
fell back—DEAD.</p>

<p class="ph2">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>Reader, we thank you for your kind attention. Our tale is told, and
we shall impose upon it but a moment longer. It would not probably
interest you to know that the twenty thousand dollars worth of forged
notes, forged by the dead man, still remain in the hands of Mr. Jonah
Nipper—and are likely so to do for all time to come. During the first
three years of their married life, Ben and his beautiful wife received
a letter without a signature. It told of a young girl that had been
betrayed by a heartless man, and persuaded by him to leave her humble
home. Harassed by her importunities in a moment of weakness to his
cold, crafty self, he had allowed a marriage ceremony to be performed.
Shortly after, the man's uncle died leaving provisions in his will that
made the man <i>hate</i> the poor helpless being he found himself tied to.
Her death was his only release. A dark night on a Hudson River steamer,
a blow and a splash in the waters, and he thought himself a free man.
But the girl lived. Lived to hunt him down with the fury of a tigress.
In poverty she pursued her revenge. As a tramp, in male attire, she
tracked her would be murderer. At last revenge seemed to come within
her reach. She would wait until he had violated the law, and then crush
him and his hopes, as a bigamist. But meanwhile the love that had died
blossomed anew. She thought to live and love once more. It was not to
be. The object of her new love had given his heart to another. Still
she loved him, and as a last offering of her love placed within his
reach the idol of his heart, all unsullied.</p>

<p>Both Bertha and Ben strove to discover her whereabouts. From that day
to this, "<i>Tommy</i>" has been neither seen nor heard of by them. They
live in all the luxury wealth can offer. As happy as happy can be.
Smythe, Hough and Wasson were at the wedding, and all claim to have
provided Ben with this terrestrial paradise by sending him on that trip
to New Orleans. The Cleveland's house is known to the fraternity of the
foot-path far and wide. There is not a vagabond of them but knows that
a hearty meal and substantial help await all who knock at that door.
And their calls are numerous and frequent.
